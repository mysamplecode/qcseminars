<h5>Rick Otton</h5>
<p><strong>Rick Otton</strong>, the showman of property entrepreneurs and original pioneer of creative property strategies, is internationally admired by the property industry for his maverick real estate concepts. A man of dedicated vision he is founder and CEO of We Buy Houses, a leading property enterprise which Rick has successfully expanded into the international markets of America, the UK, New Zealand and Australia.</p>

<p>Rick&#8217;s success has been achieved through recognising property profits can be maximised when you start to create strategies relating to the terms under which the property is acquired or sold, and not simply relying on price-led strategies. Rick&#8217;s refreshing concepts allow the buying, selling and trading of houses using little or no money of your own to create what everyone is looking for, super-cash flow as well as profits.</p>
<p>Rick was fortunate to be living in America during the late eighties when banks were facing one of the biggest challenges ever seen in finance history, the famous Savings and Loans Crisis. It created an environment where home-loans were practically abolished, leading Rick to create an innovative number of systems using terms finance which allowed people to buy and sell houses without relying on the banks. Fast-forward fifteen years and Rick&#8217;s unique systems and processes are used everyday all over the world.</p>
<p>His dynamic approach to property investment has created We Buy Houses into a successful brand synonymous with entrepreneurship and is now operated side-by-side with a dynamic property education business. With leading real estate courses, education seminars and home study packs, Rick travels the world sharing his strategies, skills and experience. His celebrated energy, passion and mentoring style reflected in his courses, including his legendary Go Direct course.</p>
<p>This enthusiastic, over-achiever has already accomplished many of his life ambitions including: starring in his own TV show, recording an album and travelling the world. Now the industry eagerly awaits the publication of Rick&#8217;s first book, an eccentric mix of business and biography. And if it follows Rick&#8217;s successful life-mantra it will be punctuated with his classic mix of inventiveness and humour.</p></div>

<h5>George Fokas</h5>
<p><strong>FACT: Your bank balance reflects your investment in your own Financial Education.</strong><br />

<strong>George Fokas</strong> is a Global Investor and Trader with over 8 years experience. George started investing with Property but found out very quickly that unless you had CASHFLOW, there was a limit to how many properties you could purchase. He went in search of a strategy that could provide him with Cashflow generation from day one and the stock market was the area that could provide this. After completing many courses on the Stock market with very little consistent results, he came across Sharelord® in 2000 which helped him achieve phenomenal results.</p>
<p>George left school at the age of 17 and went straight into a J O B working in the Insurance Industry. George was in this industry for 10 years and for the last 3 years in his J O B was trading the stock market and building his funds and building his pillars. In 2003 George was able to sack his boss and work from home trading the stock market at his leisure generating over and above what he was earning in a J O B. George went into business acquiring 2 child care centres in 2003 and worked in the business till February 2007 where he sold them both. Since February 2007 he has been a stay at home dad with his 2 beautiful children and his wonderful wife.</p>
<p>George trades from home and spend as much time as he can with his family. He gave himself PERMISSION TO SUCCEED!</p>
<p>George came on board with Nik Halik and FFI in June 2007 to support and promote Nik Halik’s Sharelord®. George now heads the Sharelord® Support team along with presenting the phenomenal features of Sharelord® to people around the world at various events.</p>
<p>The unveiling of Sharelords® real Stock Market secret of trading is as follows: We open up the majority of our stock market positions with a credit as opposed to a debit position scenario: meaning we generate a guaranteed income premium on our transactions up front as opposed to paying to speculate with the hope of making money like most do.</p>

<p>Very simply, the Education and knowledge you will learn from George and Sharelord® could be the turning point in your financial life. You will discover the ultimate investment enhanced moneymaking skills of Sharelord® in the United States.</p>

<p>George loves to trade and invest on the Stock Market. It is his passion for many reasons. He has the ability to trade anywhere in the world. As long as he can connect to the internet, he can trade and make money. Nowadays that means almost everywhere. He has no boss, no employees and no mounds of paper requiring his daily attention. He sets his own hours and has plenty of time to devote to his family. All George needs is a computer and he is in business. Above all George makes enough money to enjoy a fantastic quality of life all thanks to a consistent conservative Stock Market Strategy.</p>
<p>Fear exists because of risk or at least a failure to understand and manage risk. Past trading experiences reinforces their beliefs when they hear that the markets are down again &#8211; little do they know that you can make more money when the markets drop using some of the strategies in Sharelord®. George decided that he could be most helpful to baby-boomers, new traders, and even experienced investors if he could provide specific information on how to appreciate risk and then how to use strategies that would substantially reduce or, in certain situations, even remove risk entirely. You will learn specifically how to profit in up, down, and sideways markets all thanks to the Mentoring that George provides to his own students.</p>
<p>Whether you are a novice trader, a baby-boomer looking toward retirement, or a seasoned investor, if you are serious about your money and serious about your investments, George believes Sharelord® will help you advance your skills and help you control risk better than you ever have before with consistent conservative returns.</p>

<h5>Carly Crutchfield</h5>
<p>Hi, I&#8217;m <strong>Carly Crutchfield</strong> and just in case we haven&#8217;t met before let me introduce myself quickly.</p>

<p>I live in Sydney, but I&#8217;m often travelling around Australia, Asia and Europe lecturing about property, managing my property developments or looking for more deals for my portfolio!</p>
<p>My interest in property started more than 10 years ago when I was a teenager. You see, I left school when I was just 12 years old and by the time I was 16 I knew I had to start making money &#8211; but I had absolutely no qualifications. I discovered property investment when I found a book at my Dad&#8217;s house and I have been on that track (with a few vias here and there!) ever since. I have continued to educate myself through literally hundreds of seminars, books, DVDs, courses and on the job learning.</p>
<p>I have put much of my education into use and lived to see make mistakes, and make profits and see what works and what doesn&#8217;t. And along the way I have come up with a few strategies of my own that have proven to be extremely successful and profitable. To date I have been involved in more than 300 property transactions and over 150 million dollars worth of development including optioning, constructing and selling. After some of my friends saw what I was doing in property they asked if I could show them how to do it too, so I did. Fast forward a few years and I have educated more than 10,000 people on the strategies of property investment and development and seen many of them go on to see the same success and in same cases more!</p></div>

<p>Here’s just a sample of what you’ll discover during their presentation&#8230;</p>
<p>• Why being absolutely techno-phobic can actually be a HUGE advantage if you’re interested in making money on the internet sooner.<br />
• How to quickly, easily and cheaply identify a hot selling product every single time, so you can be sure there’s a market for your idea.<br />

• How to test as many products as you like for peanuts, so you only put time, money and effort into something you know will work for you.<br />
• What to do to get prospects to buy from you initially AND then continue to spend more and more money with you in the future.<br />
• The quickest, easiest and cheapest way to hook it all up to eCommerce &#8211; discover the power of shopping carts!<br />
• How you can bypass the money grubbing bank fees and get paid directly.<br />

<div id="speaker"><img class="alignleft" src="http://quantumchangeseminars.com/programs/wp-content/themes/default/images/mal_emery_photo.jpg" alt="Mal Emery" width="164" height="185" />
<h5>Mal Emery</h5>
<p><strong>&#8220;Breakthrough Marketing: The 7 Keys To Making $100,000 In The Next 100 Days&#8221;</strong> Over 10,000 business owners in dozens and dozens of categories rely on Mal’s outrageously effective and rebellious marketing and advertising ideas to ‘cut’ through the clutter and achieve extraordinary results.</p>
<p>Mal is the author of the best selling book “Your Right To Be Rich &#8211; The 9 No-Bull Laws Of Speed Wealth”, and during this unique event you’ll learn the powerful techniques and proven strategies many people have already successfully used to build their wealth.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve seen or heard Mal speak before, or if you own everything he has ever written, recorded or produced&#8230; and even if you think of yourself as a super knowledgeable marketer&#8230; during Mal’s presentation, you’ll hear plenty of information that you have never heard, thought of or even considered before&#8230;</p>

<p>You see, Mal has long believed that ‘Get Rich Quick’ evokes an undeserved negative response, after all who’d want to try and get rich slow? In fact, according to Mal, a common phrase among his members is, “When you figure out the ‘money game’, you wonder where it’s been hiding all these years!”.</p>
<p>Here’s just some of what you’ll discover during Mal’s revolutionary presentation:<br />
• Why most people never enjoy total financial freedom.  Right here Mal will reveal the big mistake most people make and why the vast majority will retire broke<br />
• The BIG BIG mistake most people make when they want to make money fast. This outcome needs to be avoided like the plague and will stop you dead in your tracks<br />
• Why most people can’t get their head around $100,000 in 100 days. I’ll bet YOU don’t believe it’s possible.  In fact, Mal&#8217;s had $100,000 days!!<br />
• Money is made mentally before it is collected physically. Most people are broke because they have more hang-ups about money then they do about sex!<br />
• The big breakthrough that separates the winners from the losers. How to stop being a loser and start being a winner in the money game<br />
• How to get them to throw money at you. Fewer than 1 in 100 business owners truly understand and apply this strategy correctly. As a consequence they work too hard and earn too little<br />

• How to create killer offers. You can literally afford to get everything else wrong, but if you know how to create killer offers you can still make a fortune<br />
• During your Success Secrets Wealth Creation Seminar, Mal won&#8217;t just speak&#8230; he will present a mind-expanding, brutally honest, &#8220;NO BS&#8221; smorgasbord of some of the most unorthodox, outrageously effective techniques, strategies and marketing &#8216;tricks&#8217; you’ll see anywhere in the world!</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s No Better Man To Show You Than Mal Emery”<br />
&#8220;I joined Mal&#8217;s Platinum coaching group to learn how to make more money in my own wellness practices. Not only did I do that but I have now become a coach myself in the wellness industry and in fact run small and large seminars annually. If you’re thinking about coaching there&#8217;s no better man to show you than Mal.&#8221; &#8211; Wayne Pickstone, Hervey Bay Wellbeing Centre, Qld</p></div>

<div id="speaker"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1372" title="Nic Lucas" src="http://programs.qcseminars.com/files/2009/07/niclucas.jpg" alt="Nic Lucas" width="164" height="185" />
<h5>Nic Lucas</h5>
<p>Nic Lucas is an entrepreneur with a background in medical research, behaviour change, publishing and education &#8211; he&#8217;s even a lecturer in neuroscience!.  Since coming out of hiding just a few months ago, he is now an in-demand speaker about wealth creation and personal development.  He is passionate about helping people understand why they &#8216;get stuck&#8217; and how they can move forward.  He&#8217;s an online business fanatic and can show you how you can use your brain AND the internet to create the life of your dreams.</p>
<p>Nic presents the internet as another fantastic business channel &#8211; he gives you the big picture &#8211; the real picture &#8211; so that you truly understand how you can use the internet for multiple business models.  He&#8217;ll tell you the truth about internet marketing without the hype.  He&#8217;s spent over 50K on his &#8216;internet&#8217; education and believes that you don&#8217;t have to spend anywhere near that amount!</p>

<p>He&#8217;s an evangelist for new or frustrated internet marketers and his mission is to give them the &#8216;right&#8217; directions.  Nic has many websites, including membership sites that produce recurring income, and affiliate sites that earn him money while he&#8217;s working on other things &#8211; or even when he&#8217;s on holiday!  Just recently, he went to a medical conference for 2 days and earned $3,500 while he was sightseeing!</p>
<p>He&#8217;s now in partnership with legendary Australian Internet Marketer, James Schramko.  James provides one of the most extensive and valuable internet marketing training programs in the world &#8211; and he is based right here in Australia.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard Nic speak before, then you&#8217;re in for a surprise &#8211; because of his background and training, he sees things in quite a different way.  Just being around Nic will make you feel as if everything is possible.  Nic says that on the internet &#8220;the answer is always &#8216;yes&#8217;, and when you find a &#8216;no&#8217; then that&#8217;s just a &#8216;yes&#8217; dressed up as a new opportunity (NO)!&#8221;</p>

<p>From very humble beginnings Nic has come to understand what it takes to be successful.  A high school drop out who thought he &#8220;wasn&#8217;t very smart&#8221;, he then became the first in his family to attend University and is now in the top 2% of educated Australians.  He has started businesses, bought businesses and sold businesses &#8211; all of them successful.  He also started a publishing company, grew this company internationally and then sold it to a multi-national.  He&#8217;s an experienced property investor with a portfolio spanning three Australian states and New Zealand.  He&#8217;s used negative gearing, positive gearing, no-money down, off-the-plan, renovations, sub-divisions and property development.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s also faced tough times and experienced the darker side of life.  In 2001, he lost most of his money in the dot com crash.  In 2006, after emergency surgery, he spent a week in hospital during which time he stopped breathing a number of times and had what they call &#8216;a near death like&#8217; experience.  Then, after recovering, he almost lost a business due to &#8216;the fine print&#8217; &#8211; but turned this situation around within 3 weeks to make a profit!  In the past, Nic also suffered from anxiety and panic attacks and knows what it&#8217;s like to lose hope for the future.  He completely recovered and now he&#8217;s anything BUT anxious and has written a book and program all about overcoming anxiety.</p>

<p>He is now working on his latest book, Possibility to Actuality: Real People, Real Strategies, in which he describes the 7 steps that everyone follows on the path to success.  And these aren&#8217;t just some steps he made up. Being a researcher he settled on these 7 steps after interviewing successful people, analyzing the interviews and then seeing how his findings related to research in the field of human behaviour change (it&#8217;s deep stuff, but he makes it easy to understand).</p>
<p>Nic is an inspirational speaker you don&#8217;t want to miss.  Whether you have an existing business or want to start a new business, Nic will show you how and why the internet must be a part of your plans.  Whether you want to go full-time online, or use the internet to supplement your offline business, Nic will show you how.  And if you&#8217;ve got a hidden dream &#8211; something you&#8217;ve been wanting to do but just haven&#8217;t known how to start &#8211; Nic will show you how you can turn that dream, that possibility, into an actuality.</p>
<p>What people are saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Before I met Nic, I was overwhelmed with so many different things to tackle in so many corners of the internet. I credit Nic Lucas for helping me understand how internet marketing, SEO, social networking, and everything else fit together to add bottom line to my profits. I would recommend any business owner to invest time and money consulting with Nic when marketing to the world wide web.&#8221; &#8211; Anton Hamer, Plan Assist Pty Ltd, Sydney.</p>

<p>&#8220;I attended a one day workshop with Nic Lucas.  Nic has pored many hundreds of hours into working through the intricacies of this area and has applied his brilliant mind to this subject matter.  It is obvious why Nic is considered such a topclass teacher.  He took us logically and sequentially through the learning process with hands on practical exercises as well as detailing us with his very comprehensive knowledge of how to build a business in this area.  I would highly recommend Nic to anyone contemplating developing an online business or an online presence for their existing business.&#8221; &#8211; Peter Green, Harley Place Health, Sydney.</p>

<h5>The Renovation Couple: Cherie Barber &amp; Stephen Tolle</h5>

<p>Cherie and Stephen are business partners who reside in Balmain, Sydney. Both threw in their full-time jobs, half way through their first renovation project which saw them earn more money on the weekends renovating, than their full-time positions.</p>
<p>Stephen + Cherie<br />
In the first 10 months of their renovating career, Cherie and Stephen bought, renovated and sold 6 houses with a combined value of $6.3 million with no stable income and little money behind them. After total renovating costs and discharging all mortgages, the couple gained a combined net profit of AUD $1.15 million within the first 10 months of renovating. These results prompted them to move into a career as professional renovators / property investors.</p>
<p>The tremendous success achieved by this couple is attributed to very specific disciplines and methodologies used for all property acquisitions and renovation projects undertaken. Their aim is to teach others, specifically how to renovate for profit and achieve financial freedom through this avenue.</p>
<p>Cherie and Stephen&#8217;s combined passion for property has seen them regularly featured in Australian wide media including major metropolitan and suburban newspapers, property investment magazines, internet and talk show programs. On a larger scale, Cherie and Stephen also appeared as regular TV renovators on prime time TV via Channel Seven&#8217;s Today Tonight program and were frequently dubbed as the Australian Renovation King and Queen. They have appeared over 20 times on Today Tonight, commenting specifically on property renovating and providing more general property advice. The couple also completed a 6 show renovation series with Channel Seven which put their skills and knowledge to the test and in full public display to a nationwide audience.</p>
<p>To date, Cherie Barber and Stephen Tolle have transacted over $48,600,000 in property and have made outstanding profits, year after year, regardless of market conditions. They currently have renovation and building projects in progress to a combined end value of $11 Million. Property is their sole investment strategy, one which gives them complete control over their investments and the financial freedom to live life as they please.</p>
<p>In order to improve their construction knowledge, they are both currently studying construction via correspondence and will eventually obtain formal builders qualifications. In order to keep at the top of their field, they still regularly attend other property seminars due to their relentless passion for continuous self improvement. For even if they only learn 1 new thing, it&#8217;s a new weapon for them to further again improve their processes and the results they achieve as Australia&#8217;s top renovation experts.</p>

<div class="paddingstandard"><p style="margin-top:0px;padding-top:0px;margin-top:10px;"><span class="handwritten penblue">Dear  Friend,</span></p>
<p>Did  you know that there is a <strong>SINGLE</strong> factor that separates people who are successful  in life from those who are failures? That component is how you harness your  <strong>PERSONAL POWER.</strong>&nbsp; </p>
<p>People  who use their power the right way will take their dreams and make them come  true.&nbsp; They are fearless in their drive  and will automatically take immediate, massive action and never give up until  they are enjoying their dream lifestyle.</p>
<p>On  the other hand, people who lack this power still have the same yearnings and  desires as everyone else BUT they stay stuck and unfulfilled.&nbsp; They never make their dreams come true.&nbsp; Their lives are an endless series of <strong>“What If?”</strong> questions that torture them.</p>
<p><img style="float:right;padding-left:20px;width:340px;" src="images/success.jpg">Many  people feel powerless in their lives.&nbsp;<br>
  They live forever at the whim of others  &ndash; bosses they don't like,  banks  and credit card companies and others holding them back.&nbsp; They never discover the secret to the  incredible power that is hidden inside them.</p>
<p>For  most people, harnessing this power is just a dream or a fantasy.&nbsp; But now, <strong>YOU</strong> can be on the way to achieving  your dreams faster than you ever thought possible.</p>

<p>With  this <strong>PROVEN</strong> science of achievement, you can enjoy success in meeting new  friends, developing rewarding relationships, finding a better job, becoming  financially secure and create the life you want.&nbsp; </p>

<h2 class="red middler"><span class="fontface">Introducing NLP - "The Science Of Success For the 21st Century" That Will Change Your Life Forever</span></h2>
<div class="paddingstandard"><p>The single most important key to living your dreams is using your <strong>personal power. </strong>No matter what your dream is, you make it a reality when you master this skill.  You'll be able to <strong>handle every challenge</strong> along the way and you'll make things happen incredibly fast.</p>
<p>Let me warn you…you may be stunned when you realise just how high you can soar…  </p>
<p>…and how you may have been held back in the past.  When you are free of the prison of doubts, fears and self-limiting beliefs, you can have a <strong>brand new life. </strong></p>

</div>

<div style="background: url(images/circled.gif) no-repeat; padding: 25px 50px 4px 0;background-position:5px 5px;margin-bottom:15px;padding-bottom:25px;height:170px;">
  <p style="padding-left:50px;padding-right:30px;padding-top:30px;text-align:center;"><strong>NLP  &ndash; Neuro Linguisitic Programming</strong> - is the key that will turn the lock and  release your personal power. In  fact, it's the key to <strong>UNLIMITED POWER</strong> in your life. Think  of NLP as the <strong>OPERATING MANUAL</strong> for your most important possession &ndash; <strong>YOUR MIND.</strong></p></div>
  <div class="paddingstandard">
  
  <p><span class="handwritten penblue">That's right!</span></p>
  
  <p>Those six inches or so between your ears is the key to <strong>EVERYTHING</strong>.</p>
  <p>The problem is that when you arrived on Planet Earth, nobody gave you the instruction manual for your mind!    </p>
  <p>As a result, unless you've been incredibly fortunate, you're probably not using your mind to its full power…    </p>
  <p>…and you're not achieving anywhere near what you're truly capable of.    </p>
  <p><strong>EVEN WORSE</strong>…you may be holding yourself back…even sabotaging yourself without knowing it!    </p>
  <p>But it's <strong>NOT YOUR FAULT.    </strong></p>
  <p>You simply haven't been given the information you need to take full control and take charge of your mind and your life once and for all.    </p></div>

 <h2 class="red middler">Never Before Has It Been  This Easy<br /> To Have The Power Of NLP  For Yourself</h2>
 <p>If  we procrastinate, we're delaying our dreams &ndash; maybe for a few years or maybe  forever.</p>
<p>And  when you delay your dreams…you miss out on life.</p>
<p>The  ideal is to <strong>live our dreams NOW before it's too late.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>It's  important to <strong>take some action each and every day</strong>, no matter how big or how  small in pursuit of our dreams. <img style="float:right;padding-left:0px;padding-top:30px;" src="images/confidence.jpg">And the way that thousands of people just like  you have done that is with the <strong>NLP Certification Scholarship Training program.</strong></p>
<p>You  might be reading this report and thinking that you'd like to make some changes  in your life.&nbsp; But sometimes, even though  you'd like a better job, to feel closer to your family or even just feel good  about yourself, something stops you from taking action.</p>
<p>One  of the characteristics of people who are confident in using their personal  power is that they immediately take action.&nbsp;  If you want to make your dreams reality, like so many before you have  done, I want you to focus your attention on what you truly desire deep inside.</p>
<p><strong>Get  a picture of what you want.&nbsp;</strong> Make it  vivid and focused and as real as possible.&nbsp;  Because I'm about to reveal how to make your dream come alive.</p>

<p>…but  first allow me to tell you about Vicki from Sylvania  in New South Wales.</p>
<h2 class="red middler">When Vicki Discovered  NLP…</h2>
<p><img src="images/vickibw.jpg" align="right">Vicki  wanted to change her life…</p>
<p>…but  she had doubts about NLP and if it could help her. </p>
<p>You  see, she'd been disappointed before by events where she thought she was going  to get everything she needed…</p>
<p>…only  to find that it was one long sales pitch and that she would have invest  thousands of dollars to discover the real inside secrets.</p>
<p>So  she was sceptical.&nbsp; Very sceptical, in  fact.</p>
<p>Fortunately,  she had the good sense to keep an open mind and not give up on her dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Vicki  took action and attended the NLP Certification Scholarship Training and…</strong></p>
<div id="bluebox">
<h2 class="blue extras">…Her Life Changed Instantly, Forever!<br>

In just a few short months, here's what happened for Vicki…</h2>
<ul class="redticks">
  <li><strong>Her family life and relationship</strong> with her husband was transformed</li>

<p style="margin-top:15px;">…<strong>PLUS</strong>  at the training she connected with dozens of like-minded individuals and built  a network of friends that has enriched her life and supported her on the path  to success.</p>
<p>So  NLP works &ndash; even if you're sceptical (like Vicki was!)</p>
<p>How  did Vicki achieve all this?</p>
<p>She  <strong>TRANSFORMED</strong> herself by taking advantage of the <strong>LIVE TRAINING</strong> and coaching at  the <strong style="color:red;">NLP Certification Scholarship Training.</strong></p>

<p>…and  the best way to grasp its power is to <strong>EXPERIENCE</strong> it for yourself.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The  best way to master the science of NLP is to <strong>DO IT YOURSELF.</strong></p>
<p>If  you could change your life by reading a self-help book you would have done it  years ago.&nbsp; The answer isn't another book  or another fast-talking infomercial guru.</p>
<p>You  need to create a new way of living and develop your own personal power with  NLP.</p>
<p>When  you've completed the <strong style="color:red;">NLP Certification Scholarship Training</strong>…you'll know how to  use your personal power whenever you wish for the rest of your life</p>

<h2 class="blue extras">Your International  Faculty Of Trainers And Coaches</h2>

<p>You'll  have the benefit of not just one, but TWO internationally acclaimed presenters  and trainers…</p>

<h2 class="blue extras">Introducing International Trainer George Faddoul…</h2>

<p>So, at most of our training events, you get the benefit of<strong> special guest trainers</strong> joining lead trainer George Faddoul.<br />
</p>
<p><img style="float:right;" src="images/newimproved.png">Every single one of these guest trainers is known to us personally and has been carefully selected.  <strong>Only the VERY BEST trainers</strong> are invited to join our faculty and typically they will be qualified in NLP at the highest level PLUS have high-level credentials in related fields such as <strong>education, business, communication, psychology and hypnosis.</strong> </p>

<div style="float:left;"></div>

<p><span style="padding-top: 40px;" class="handwritten penblue">Now  you may be wondering…</span></p>

<h2 class="red">How Much Is A 4 Day,  Hands-On, Life Changing Training Worth To You?</h2>
<p>When  you think about it, a training like this that unlocks your personal power to  create whatever you want in life could <strong>easily be worth $5,000 or even $10,000.</strong></p>
<p>And,  in fact, pretty much anywhere else, that's what you'd have to invest for a NLP  Certification level training. The <span class="style1"><strong>minimum you'd pay would be $3,695…</strong></span></p>
<p>…and  it's <strong>well worth the investment.</strong></p>
<p>But you won't have to find anywhere near that amount to attend this <strong>NLP  Certification Scholarship Training.</strong> Our philosophy is to give back so you have the oppurtinity to attend the certification training with a FULL scholarship and all you have to come up with is a <strong style="color:red;">modest $97 one-off fee </strong>to help cover some of the administration costs of the training. </p>
<p>All  you have to come up with is a<strong style="color:red;"> modest $97 one-off fee </strong>to help cover some of the  administration costs of the training.</p>
<p>(And  this only covers a fraction of the costs, as you'll see when I explain the  incredible<strong> EXTRA <span style="color:red;">FREE GIFT BONUSES</span> worth $1,596.97</strong> you will receive.)</p>
<p><span class="handwritten penblue"><span style="padding-top: 40px;">So,  the obvious question is…</span></span></p>
<h2 class="red">Why Am I Giving You<br />  <span style="color:#94122e;">$5,291.97</span> Worth Of Training <br>

It's our way of giving back to the community.</li>
  <li><strong>Secondly</strong>, I can appreciate the fact that you may be sceptical about NLP and whether it really lives up to the promises.&nbsp;My intention is to make NLP available to everyone with an irresistible offer so that even the most sceptical person would be crazy not to join us and find out what all the fuss is about.</li>

 <p> <a name="nine"><span class="handwritten penblue" style="font-size:18px;">Do I have to do the  &ldquo;30 Day Action Plan&rdquo;?</span></p>
<p>If you wish to gain your formal NLP Certification, then you  will need to complete the &ldquo;30 Day Action Plan&rdquo;.&nbsp;  However, you may choose not to and you will still gain huge benefits  from the techniques and strategies taught at the live training.</p>
<p><a name="ten"><span class="handwritten penblue" style="font-size:18px;">How does the  certification process work?</span></p>

<p>  To gain your certification, you will need to successfully  complete an &ldquo;Open Book&rdquo; written test.&nbsp;  You can complete this in your own time and at home.&nbsp; To be successful in the test, you will need  to complete the &ldquo;30 Day Action Plan&rdquo;.</p>

<p>  <a name="eleven"><span class="handwritten penblue" style="font-size:18px;">Do I have to complete  the certification process?</span></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s completely optional, but unless you complete the  certification process you will not be formally recognised as an NLP  practitioner.</p>
<p><a name="twelve"><span class="handwritten penblue" style="font-size:18px;">What will I be able  to do with the certification?</span></p>
<p>As a certified NLP Practitioner, you will be able to use all  the strategies and techniques you learn to both improve your own life and to help  friends and family.&nbsp; In addition, if you  are currently studying at university, you may be able to obtain a course credit  as a result of gaining your NLP Certification.</p>
<p>If you wish to practice professionally as an NLP coach or  therapist, we highly recommend that you undertake our NLP Master Practitioner  Training. </p>
<p><a name="thirteen"><span class="handwritten penblue" style="font-size:18px;">Is the course  recognized and by whom? </span></p>
<p>There is currently no governing body with regards to NLP.  All current boards of NLP are privately owned and therefore, set their own  standards. As a company, QC Seminars meet the standards and requirements of the  Californian Institute of NLP for all of our NLP certification programs. </p>
<p>We are currently in the process of setting up the first  board of i-NLP (the proprietary form of NLP taught by QC Seminars). When  complete, the board will be the biggest board in Australia. </p>
<p>You may also be able to use your NLP Certification to offset  modules of a university degree. </p>
<p><a name="fourteen"><span class="handwritten penblue" style="font-size:18px;">I&rsquo;ve already done  some NLP training.&nbsp; What will I get out  of this training?</span></p>
<p>Firstly, revising material will be very beneficial for you.  (&ldquo;Repetition is the mother of skill.&rdquo;) Secondly, every teacher and training  program is different.&nbsp; By experiencing a  new perspective and approaching the material in a different way, you will most  likely gain new insights, a deeper understanding of NLP and greater skill in  using these powerful techniques and strategies.</p>
<p>Remember, you also get a set of valuable bonuses (including  a complete recording of the NLP Certification training) that are unavailable  elsewhere.</p>
<p><a name="fifteen"><span class="handwritten penblue" style="font-size:18px;">What do I need to  bring to the event?</span></p>
<p>To get the most out of the training, bring an open mind, a  willingness to learn and a commitment to participate 100%! Apart from that&hellip; </p>

<h2 class="blue extras">Preparing for your NLP Training</h2>

<ul class="redticks">
    <li>You       may wish to bring a jacket or jumper in case the room temperature is cooler       than you prefer</li>

  <li>You       will receive a comprehensive manual but we suggest you bring some pens and       a notebook</li>

  <li>If       you have special needs (such as a pillow for your back) please bring       appropriate items with you</li>

  <li>Water       will be provided throughout the training, but meals and other refreshments       are not provided.&nbsp; So we recommend       you bring snacks and beverages of your choice to maintain your energy       levels throughout the program</li>
  </ul>
</div><div style="float:left;"><img src="images/bluebottom.jpg"></div>

<p><a name="sixteen"><span class="handwritten penblue" style="font-size:18px;">Do I need to do any  reading or other preparation before attending the training?</span></a></p>
<p>There is no pre-study or other preparatory work required  before attending the training.&nbsp; However,  so that you get the most out of the training we recommend that you spend some  time thinking about and writing down what you want to achieve as a result of  attending this life-changing program.</p>
<p><a name="seventeen"><span class="handwritten penblue" style="font-size:18px;">Why is the training  only 4 days?&nbsp; That seems very short for a  full NLP Certification Training.</span></a></p>
<p>The course is based on a 24 day model, but we want to make  NLP available to as many people as possible. So we have created a comprehensive  and accelerated 4 day training program. After the live training, there is a  home study component for you to complete. This is the &ldquo;30 Day Action Plan&rdquo; that  will complete the training so that you have all the knowledge and skills  required to qualify as a certified NLP Practitioner. </p>
<p><a name="fifteen"><span class="handwritten penblue" style="font-size:18px;">Why are you providing  this training for just the one-off administration fee of $97?</span></a></p>
<p>Well, there are 3 reasons&hellip;</p>
<ul class="redarrows">
  <li><span class="handwritten penblue" style="font-size:18px;">Firstly, </span>I am passionate about transforming lives by making this opportunity       available to everyone.&nbsp; In the past       it&rsquo;s only been available to people who were able to invest $3,695 or       more.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve personally transformed       my life with the power of NLP and so have thousands of people just like       you <em>(take a look at the many success stories in this letter).</em>&nbsp; <strong>I want to help thousands more to do the       same.</strong></li>

  <li><span class="handwritten penblue" style="font-size:18px;">Secondly,</span>       I can appreciate the fact that <strong>you may be sceptical about NLP and whether       it really lives up to the promises.</strong>&nbsp;       My intention is to make NLP available to everyone with an       irresistible offer so that even the most sceptical person would be crazy       not to join us and find out what all the fuss is about.</li>

  <li><span class="handwritten penblue" style="font-size:18px;">Thirdly,</span>       I confess, I want to get you<strong> &ldquo;hooked&rdquo;.</strong>&nbsp;       That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m taking the chance that you&rsquo;ll be amazed, thrilled       and delighted by your experience at the NLP Certification Scholarship       Training.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m counting on you       finding this training so valuable that you&rsquo;ll want to take advantage of       our other training programs and that you&rsquo;ll want to be part of our       <strong>community of success-minded individuals.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Just to be clear&hellip;there&rsquo;s no catch and nothing is held back.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re getting a full, complete NLP Certification  training.&nbsp; At the end of the event,  you&rsquo;ll have <strong>everything you need to unleash your personal power</strong> and create the  life that you want for yourself.</p>

Although I had a pretty good idea of where I was heading before this course, not only did it cement the fantastic knowledge I had absorbed in the NLP Practitioner course, but also it allowed me to discover some new skills (a whole bunch of really good stuff) plus remove some potentially limiting belief. I can now see things differently and far more vividly. </p>

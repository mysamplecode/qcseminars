        <p><img title="Dear friend" src="http://www.quantumchangeseminars.com/programs/nlp/nlpscholarship/images/dearfriend.gif" alt="" width="191" height="51" /></p>
        <p>This is not just an intro to NLP weekend as many other companies offer
          in fact this IS the training that they spend a lot of time at these
          weekend intros selling you into for a minimum of $3,695.00.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">You&rsquo;re probably wondering why I&rsquo;m
          literally giving you $5,291.97 worth of training and course materials
          absolutely FREE. (you&rsquo;ll only pay the costs for materials)<br />
            <img class="aligncenter" title="Well there are a few reasons" src="http://www.quantumchangeseminars.com/programs/nlp/nlpscholarship/images/welltheresafewreasons.gif" alt="" width="410" height="50" /></p>
        <p>Firstly, I am passionate about transforming lives by making <strong>this
            opportunity available to everyone</strong>. Previously, it&rsquo;s
            only been available to those who had the inclination to invest $3,695+
            for a seminar, without knowing exactly what they would get out of
            it. I&rsquo;ve personally transformed my life through the techniques
            revealed in this seminar (as have thousands of others &ndash; check
            out the testimonials and videos on this letter) and I want to help
            thousands more do the same.</p>
        <p>Secondly, I&rsquo;m well aware of the fact most people are sceptical
          about Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) and whether it actually lives
          up to it&rsquo;s promises. After all, there&rsquo;s a lot of B.S. out
          there about &lsquo;transforming the planet.&rsquo; My intention is
          to <strong>make NLP available to everyone</strong> with an offer even
          the most sceptical person would be absolutely out of their mind not
          to join us and find out what all the fuss is about.</p>
        <p>And thirdly, I&rsquo;m trying to get you &ldquo;hooked!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s
          right, I&rsquo;m betting on the fact you&rsquo;ll gain so much value
          out of this event, you&rsquo;ll get &ldquo;addicted&rdquo; to this
          life transforming technology. In fact after attending you will agree
          that this is the <strong>BEST NLP training you&rsquo;ll ever attend</strong>.
          Period. And be so glad you took the chance, the leap of faith to join
          us and that&rsquo;s why we are making the choice so easy for you, a
          no brainer, cause let&rsquo;s face it you and I both know this is the
          most incredible offer EVER a real gift, so keep reading. All you have
          to do is say YES and clear 4 days for the most incredible days you&rsquo;ll
          ever spend&hellip;.</p>
        <h1>Why Do Leaders Including Anthony Robbins, Bill Gates and Oprah Winfrey
          rave about NLP?</h1>
        <p>Simply because it&rsquo;s proven to work. If you want to have more
          choices about your behaviour and emotions, to improve your relationships
          and the way you communicate, and create better results through becoming
          a greater thinker, then NLP can provide you with a step-by-step framework
          for achieving all this and more. Not just in the short term, but lasting
          transformation which stay with you for your entire life.</p>

        <p>These people (and the thousands that have learnt the secrets of NLP)
          have been so <strong>successful because they have applied NLP to their
          daily life</strong>. NLP is short for Neuro Linguistic Programming.
          And it&rsquo;s the same technology Oprah Winfrey, Anthony Robbins and
          Bill Gates (and hundreds of thousands of others) use to achieve consistent
          results most of us can only dream of.</p>
        <h1 style="text-align: center;">In a nutshell, NLP is the study of excellence
          and how to produce the specific results you desire in your life on
          a consistent basis.<br />

            them a head start in life?</p>
        <p>&bull; <strong>If you are a therapist, coach or educator:</strong> how
          would it feel to know you can <span class="alert-big">help your clients
          make massive shifts in their life</span> in just a few sessions? To
          possess skills very few people possess so people are constantly calling

        <h1>Here are 9 good reasons why you should move heaven
          and earth to make sure you are one of the first 93 people to
          lock in your position for this once only, never to be repeated event&hellip;</h1>
        <p>&bull;  Because you&rsquo;ll get <strong>proven strategies</strong> which
          are time-tested to work . No part of NLP is as a result of chance.</p>
        <p>&bull;  Because you&rsquo;ll <strong>receive a step-by-step process</strong> outlining
          exactly what the process is to move from where you are right now to
          where you want to be&hellip; whether it&rsquo;s changes in your personal
          life, your business or your clients, you can feel certain every single
          aspect will be covered. Get ready for training unlike anything else
          you&rsquo;ve ever come across. Compared to self help / business growth
          courses NLP is totally unique. Why? Because every single thing you
          learn interrelates to every other aspect. You won&rsquo;t believe how
          simple everything is to grasp, use and apply to produce the type of
          results you&rsquo;re looking to achieve.</p>
        <p>&bull;  Because you&rsquo;re not going to have to wait years to see
          changes in your life after completing the NLP Training. That&rsquo;s
          right. Expect to see measurable results quickly. In fact, within weeks
          of walking out the door at the completion of the seminar, your friends
          will notice the changes in you. More importantly, you&rsquo;ll be able
          to use these strategies to improve your relationships, financial well-being,
          career prospects as well as to help your friends and family right away.</p>
        <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2051" title="Dazzling Results!" src="http://programs.qcseminars.com/files/2009/08/dazzling.gif" alt="" width="381" height="64" /></p>
        <p>&bull;  Because you want to know why so many people can&rsquo;t break
          their negative habits no matter what they try. <strong>Imagine knowing
          the precise steps</strong> involved in shifting both your own, and
          others negative habits, giving you the magical power to see almost
          automatic changes to your life and the life of others.</p>
        <p>&bull;  Because<strong> you&rsquo;ll understand strategies</strong> even
          most counsellors and psychologists are totally oblivious to. And you&rsquo;ll
          be able to recognise which strategies apply to different individuals
          and personality styles. NLP graduates are widely recognised for being
          able to help people no one else can.</p>
        <p>&bull;  Because you&rsquo;ll hold the <strong>power in your hands
            to eradicate fears and phobias</strong> which have been holding you
            back for years&hellip; and help others do the same. Now&hellip; you&rsquo;ll
            be the person in the drivers seat&hellip; in control of your mind&hellip; and
            in a position to swiftly &lsquo;kick&rsquo; problems that have been
            troubling you for years within a matter of hours. You can&rsquo;t
            put a price on that, can you? (And neither can others, which means,
            if you choose to set yourself up as a practitioner, others will pay
            you a kings ransom to help them release the pain in their life.)</p>
        <p>&bull;  Because you&rsquo;ll know exactly how to turn any dream into
          a reality with lightning speed (actually, you&rsquo;ll get a proven
          step-by-step process for the <strong>7 steps to transforming an idea
          in your mind into a rock solid reality</strong> faster than you ever
          imagined possible)</p>
        <p>&bull;  Because, if you&rsquo;re a business owner you&rsquo;ll understand <strong>how
            to get an edge over your competition</strong>&hellip; safely increasing
            your profits&hellip;</p>
        <p>&bull;  Because you&rsquo;ll quickly grasp what&rsquo;s required to <strong>bust
            through the limitations which are stopping you from achieving the
            dreams</strong> you once imagined as a child. Once you break through
            these, your business and personal life will never be the same again.</p>
        <p><strong>You&rsquo;ll learn the secrets to blasting through the limitations
            that are holding you back in business and in life.</strong></p>

        <p>George Faddoul is widely regarded as the leading NLP trainer who has
          trained thousands of people nationwide &amp; internationally, and is
          a dynamic presenter on a wide range of topics ranging from personal
          development to powerful sales training. George is a business and marketing
          expert having started 7 multi million dollar business from scratch.
          George speaks from the heart and is truly engaging &amp; fun.</p>
        <p>George started his business career working in the Banking Industry,
          for over eight years, where he began to develop his finance and customer
          service skills.</p>
        <p>This time was punctuated by an eighteen-month break to do his National
          Service for Australia. Upon leaving the Bank George entered the Automotive
          Industry and quickly became the top salesperson in a Group of twelve
          Car Dealerships.</p>
        <p>Five and a half years later he started his own used car outlet and
          operated it very successfully for approximately 9 years. George decided
          to have a break from cars, he went on to spend two years developing
          real estate and dealing in Australian Art, as well as twelve months
          together with his darling wife Nitsa and his four lovely daughters
          on the French Riviera. Refreshed, George came back to the Motor Industry,
          developing two separate New Car Dealerships and running them successfully
          for about eight years acquiring a reputation for being a marketing
          and advertising whiz.</p>
        <p>During that time, as a result of his pursuit of practical knowledge
          and his insatiable appetite for personal growth &amp; development,
          George came across NLP, he then became a <strong>Practitioner and Master
          Practitioner of NLP, Time Line Therapy and Hypnosis, as well as a Certified
          Trainer of NLP</strong>.</p>
        <p>George took his new found skills to his New Car Dealerships, taking
          them to a whole new level. During that time, he also took time off
          work to assist at various Trainings both here in Australia and in the
          US.</p>
        <p>George then sold his Car Dealerships, and decided to become a full
          time Trainer <strong>using his time to educate and empower people</strong>.</p>
        <p>That was about nine six years ago, and George has since conducted
          Seminars locally in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Also internationally
          in the Middle East and the United States. During that time, he also
          became a <strong>Certified Trainer of Hypnosis &amp; a Master Trainer
          of Time Line Therapy. He has certified more people in NLP than most
          of the other NLP trainers in Australia combined</strong></p>
        <p>George loves to travel, and enjoys the company of motivated people.
          He is the author of the best seller &#8220;How To Get a Bigger Bite
          Out Of Life&#8221; and featured in &lsquo;The Secrets of Great Coaches
          Exposed&rsquo; with two new exciting NLP and esoteric books being released
          very soon.</p>
        <p>George is a most engaging and honest NLP Trainer who actually walks
          the talk walk not just talks the talk and you can see him right here
          in Australia (for peanuts, normally $3,695 register NOW for only the
          costs of your training materials $97)</p>

        <h1>What sort of a difference do you think knowing these secrets would

        <p><strong>A massive difference</strong>. Just take a look at the testimonials

          everyone from parents, students, business owners, employees, therapists
          and athletes who have the <strong>same passion for a better life as
          you do.</strong></p>
        <p>The only thing they did was put their doubts aside&hellip; and <strong>put
            NLP to the test</strong>. For some of them, it cost several thousand

        <h1>FREE GIFT #3 &amp; #4</h1>
        <p>It really is a crazy and unfair world out there&hellip;</p>
        <p>On one hand, there are people who bust their proverbial behinds working
          year after year&hellip; slaving away for bosses and managers who don&#8217;t
          appreciate their efforts&hellip; to earn a paycheck that only just
          keeps their head above water.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, there are those who seem to <strong>magically achieve
            wealth and live life on their terms</strong>. They don&#8217;t worry
            about money because they have everything they need. They live life
            on their terms, and always seem to <strong>be off travelling the
            world, taking time off to spend with their kids, play golf or tennis,
            and really enjoying life</strong>.</p>
        <p>You may know people like this. My guess is you&#8217;d like to be
          one of these people. And if you&#8217;re not there already&hellip;</p>
        <h1>It&#8217;s Not Your Fault</h1>
        <p>Listen, it doesn&#8217;t matter how hard you work, how much you struggle
          to get ahead&hellip; the bottom line is the reason you&#8217;re not
          wealthy has more to do with what&#8217;s been programmed into your
          head from your parents, teachers and peers than anything else.</p>
        <p>And that&#8217;s why some people continue to struggle despite their
          hard work and efforts, while for others everything they touch turns
          into gold. Trust me, I know sometimes it&#8217;s easier to bury your
          head in the sand and say &#8216;Forget it.&#8217;</p>
        <p>But the good news is that included with <strong>THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY
            FREE GIFT EVER</strong>&hellip; you&#8217;ll receive these ADDITIONAL

        <p>I am well aware of the fact many of you will want to use the skills
          you learn to start your own business. After all, why wouldn&rsquo;t
          you. NLP Practitioners are widely known for earning anywhere from $75
          to $500 in a single one-hour session. How would it feel to earn that
          type of money? Pretty damn good, right! And we&rsquo;re going to give
          you exactly what you need to attract a swarm of hungry new customers

        <p>We&#8217;ve managed to twist the arm of <strong>Australia&#8217;s

        <p>You&rsquo;re guaranteed to get all of these free gifts when you are
          one of the first 93 people to say <strong>&lsquo;YES&rsquo; to THE
          MOST EXTRAORDINARY FREE GIFT EVER.</strong> And I suppose I should
          point out <strong>just one really good idea, strategy or improvement
          can easily put thousands of dollars into your pocket</strong>&hellip; save
          you years of heartache&hellip; help you overcome fears, phobias and
          problems you&rsquo;ve been trying to eradicate for years.</p>
        <h1>However, There Is Just One Little Catch</h1>
        <p>The <strong>life changing secrets revealed</strong> at this seminar
          are among the most powerful and effective tools in the world. Thousands
          of individuals have used them to create their ultimate relationship,
          a more fulfilling career, travel, and the life of their dreams. Business
          owners have used them to annihilate their competition and considerably
          lift their income in a very short period of time. And therapists, coaches
          and educators have impacted thousands of lives as a result of having
          these tools at their disposal. What you learn can transform your life
          forever, as it has for many others.</p>
        <p>But not everyone is free to join us.</p>
        <p>I am not interested in sharing this powerful information with anyone
          who is less than serious about making real and significant changes
          in their lives and the lives of others. And I am utterly serious when
          I say that, since what we&rsquo;ll be teaching at this event can help
          people transform their lives so easily, I want to restrict access to
          this material to people who actually plan to use it to make a difference.</p>
        <p>Also, you should not look at your attendance as some sort of &ldquo;weekend
          off.&rdquo; You shouldn&rsquo;t plan to attend if you are going to
          be tired, hung over, stressed or negative. Because&hellip;</p>
        <h1>This Will Be The Most Intense, Life Transforming And Liberating 4
          Days Of Your Life, And You Must Be Prepared To Take Notes</h1>
        <p>You can believe the information is going to come fast and furious,
          because it&rsquo;s our experience that, often, it&rsquo;s just one
          idea, one process, one concept that completely changes the course of
          your life forever.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Peter, a former electrician from Cronulla, walked away from this
            course and created a six figure income as an NLP consultant &amp; Trainer.</li>
          <li class="even">Maxine, from Wyong, used her new skills to help her
            family and loved ones.</li>
          <li>Mark, a former clothing manufacturer from Sydney, became a leading
            trainer and consultant in weight loss.</li>
          <li class="even">Sue from Brisbane used her NLP skills in business
            consulting.</li>
          <li>David from Melbourne trained his staff with what he learned to
            increase his company turn over.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that once you finish these 4 days,
          your life will never be the same again. Make sure you bring lots of
          paper and pens. No tape recorders will be allowed; no cameras either.
          No exceptions.</p>

        <h1>How to claim YOUR most Extraordinary *FREE Gift*&#8230;</h1>
        <p>I suppose I should point out&hellip; that this is not just an intro
          to NLP weekend as many other companies offer in fact t<strong>his IS
          the training</strong> that they spend a lot of time at these weekend
          intros selling you into and <strong>every other company in Australia
          is selling the NLP Program for a minimum of $3,695.00</strong>. Sure,
          some of them add some &lsquo;filler&rsquo; like Time Line Therapy and
          Hypnosis to extend the events to seven days and make it seem like you&rsquo;re
          getting extra value.</p>
        <p>But the reality is most people come to the events to learn about NLP.
          Mostly because they know once you start practising NLP and accepting
          clients you could charge upwards of $200.00 for a single consultation
          and that <strong>if you apply the techniques learnt you can dramatically
          improve your personal relationships and all areas of your life.</strong></p>

        <p>These people (and the thousands that have learnt the secrets of NLP)
          have been so successful because they have applied NLP to their daily

<p>Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve been troubled with the state of the economy and the fearful reaction most people had to it. It&rsquo;s definitely been one crazy roller coaster ride. Every time you turned on the TV &#8211; or opened a newspaper &#8211; it was one<strong> &lsquo;Doom and Gloom&rsquo;</strong> story after another. </p>
<p>Plummeting stock prices, dwindling superannuation funds, erratic real estate values, Global Financial Crisis&#8230;</p>

<p>You see, it bothered me when I heard about families not being able to go away for the weekend because of sky high petrol prices. Or about people being forced out of their homes because they had borrowed beyond their means&#8230;or worse, lost their jobs! </p>
<p>When I noticed the record profits the banks and supermarkets were posting on an annual basis, despite the fact most people are struggling to make ends meet&#8230;I GOT MAD!</p>
<p>Really mad! </p>
<p>I decided enough was enough, and that&rsquo;s when I came up with the idea of the <strong>Success Secrets Summit&trade;</strong> to help the average, hard-working Australian fight back and get access to the kind of insider information that others I knew were using to rake in huge profits&#8230;even when the economy had hit rock bottom!</p>
<p><strong>We&rsquo;ve had thousands of people come to our event, and the powerful Wealth Creation information they&rsquo;ve walked away with has enabled them to take charge of their financial lives&#8230;and make more money than they ever had before!</strong></p>

<p>And over the last year we&rsquo;ve seen house prices in many cities increase, the share market has clawed back much of its losses and consumer confidence is slowly returning. </p>
<p>And you know what? My hand-picked team of &lsquo;Wealth Creators&rsquo;  &#8211; who you&rsquo;ll see at <strong>Success Secrets Summit&trade; 2010 don&rsquo;t worry about the state of the economy, or predictions of recession and economic doom.</strong></p>
<h1>What are they doing differently to everyone else?</h1>
<p>Well firstly, they don&rsquo;t worry about factors they can&rsquo;t control such as interest rates, or where the ALL ORDS are today. They literally removed themselves from the negativity they saw all around them&#8230;and are making money day in and day out with their investments and money-making strategies&#8230;and taking less risk than the average investor or business person.</p>
<p>And they don&rsquo;t possess some innate ability to gaze into the future and predict which way the stock market or house prices will go.</p>
<p>Wall Street dynamo and stock picker extraordinaire, Peter Lynch, summed it up perfectly&#8230; </p>

<h1>&ldquo;If you spend 13 minutes per year trying to predict the economy, you have wasted 10 minutes.&rdquo;</h1>
<p>You see. The rich get richer regardless of the markets.</p>
<p>They rely on proven and tested money-making principles and strategies that work. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, these strategies aren&rsquo;t openly discussed in the media, or especially by financial advisers, because even they don&#8217;t know these powerful principles.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m writing to you today. With your permission, I am going to send you tickets to one of the most important events ever released to the Australian public. <span style="text-decoration:underline;" class="hilight">News of this revolutionary seminar is spreading like wildfire all over Australia</span>. When you attend, you will discover how to give your family real financial security&#8230;regardless of which direction the economy heads. And guess what? If you&rsquo;re quick&#8230;</p>

<h2>You&rsquo;re NOT alone, and it&rsquo;s definitely not your fault.</h2>
<p>And if you&rsquo;ve ever gone to bed frustrated and unsettled because of financial pressure in your life&#8230; if you&rsquo;ve ever had a deep sense of dissatisfaction because you know in your heart of hearts you have much more potential but simply don&rsquo;t know what to do to make it happen&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&#8230; then I urge you to go and lock the door&#8230; take the phone off the hook&#8230;<br />

shut down your email and instant messenger accounts&#8230;<br />
grab a cup of coffee or tea&#8230; kick off your shoes&#8230;<br />
get comfy and study every single word of this message,<br />
it&rsquo;s that important!</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
Listen:</strong> My family have been putting on seminars, boot camps and conferences for over a decade. Charging fees as high as $17,500.00 per person back in 1997. And I&rsquo;ve got to tell you, NEVER have I put together a MASSIVE EVENT that comes anything close to this.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s a very good reason behind that. </p>

<p>You see, while my own business has thrived during the Global Financial Crisis &ndash; gaining entry into the prestigious <strong>&ldquo;BRW Top 100 fastest growing businesses in Australia for 2010&rdquo;</strong>- and my fellow presenters are also making serious money, it pains me that many people have the false belief that serious wealth creation will somehow elude them. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, they work long hours earning a pay cheque to pay the bills, and in many cases, just barely get by.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>And while many complain about lack of money, few realise how easy it is to take the steps needed to free themselves from the drudgery of living from payday to payday. </p>
<p>Have you ever felt that way? </p>
<p>We all have at one stage or another. And yet we all know, deep down in the pit of our stomach, there must an easier way to true wealth and financial freedom.</p>
<p><em>But if you&rsquo;re NOT interested in making more money this year than you ever have, you should STOP reading right now.</em></p>
<p><strong>Because the income-boosting information my hand picked team of Success Secrets&trade; &#8220;wealth creators&#8221; will reveal at Success Secrets Summit&trade; 2010 is designed so anyone with a drop of initiative can implement them immediately&#8230; and quickly see their income and investment portfolio grow</strong></p>

<p>Because make no mistake, I&rsquo;ve made it my personal mission to&#8230;</p>
<h1>&ldquo;Make Australians Prosper Again&#8230;<br />
Starting With You!&rdquo;</h1>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I hate the idea that I should EVER have to go on a budget and watch every penny. Or not go away for the weekend because the bills are piling up on the fridge, or because petrol prices are so high. </p>
<p>And I definitely don&rsquo;t want to cut back on all the things that make life fun. It makes me *#^@ &#038; sick to my stomach.</p>
<p>No one should have to live without the financial freedom to have whatever their heart desires.<br />
But what I noticed was that so many people bought into the gloom&lsquo;n&rsquo;doom perpetuated by the press &ndash; and that&rsquo;s to be expected during downturns &#8211; and believe they are a victim of circumstances and can&rsquo;t do anything about it&#8230;</p>

<p>And now the economy is steaming ahead and clawing back most of the losses of the past two years, people still feel anxious about stepping out and reclaiming their right to financial freedom.<br />
It&rsquo;s crazy&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Look, the strategies you&rsquo;ll learn at  Success Secrets Summit&trade; 2010 will make you money in virtually any economic climate &ndash; barring some unforeseen total financial catastrophe &ndash; and you owe it to yourself to take full advantage of the recent swing in market fortunes, ride on the coattails of the recovery and claim your &lsquo;financial freedom&rsquo; once and for all.</strong></p>

<p>Just imagine for a moment the difference an extra $500 a week, $25,000 a year would make to your life&#8230;imagine some of the things you could spend it on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A long, planned holiday</strong> that you&rsquo;d been promising to take when you made some extra money. Travelling to that dream destination you&rsquo;ve been eyeing off in the travel agents window. Taking time off for you, just to relax and unwind.</li>
<li class="even">A brand new <span class="hilight">convertible parked in your drive way</span>. Reward yourself for all the hard work you put in everyday. And I know $25, 000 won&rsquo;t get you a shiny new Beamer outright&#8230;but it will take care of the hire purchase costs &#8211; this is how many entrepreneurs and investors pay for their wheels anyway! </li>

<li>Take a <strong>chunk out of your mortgage</strong>. With rising interest rates, you and your partner will breathe a sigh of relief&#8230;or just pay off some of those personal loans and credit cards that have been hovering over your head.</li>
<li class="even"><span class="hilight">How about spoiling your loved ones?</span> A new computer for the kids, a big screen TV for the lounge room, a romantic trip away. Add a new kitchen, buy that new dining table that not long ago seemed so expensive&#8230;or that new green turf for the lawn that never needs watering and is always lush green all year round!</li>
<li>Or maybe you&rsquo;ve decided that you want even more for you and your family<strong>&#8230;and an extra $25,000 just aint gonna cut it!</strong> You could invest your profits to bank-roll and leverage your way to investments in shares or property. Or kick off that part time business you&rsquo;ve been dreaming about. Some use the extra money in their business to hire part-time staff to take the load pressure off and increases their bottom line.</li>
</ul>
<h1>And that&rsquo;s just the tip of the iceberg.</h1>

<p>Many have used these exact same strategies &#8211; which you&rsquo;ll get &ndash; to build multi-million dollar businesses and investment portfolios&#8230;and some have even retired from the daily grind of the ratrace to enjoy a life of freedom and leisure.</p>
<h1>It&rsquo;s all yours if you want it.</h1>
<h2>Hard to believe? Perhaps. But I&rsquo;m not asking you to believe anything just yet until you see the evidence for yourself. </h2>
<p>All I ask is that you refrain from disbelieving while I show you my proof&#8230; </p>
<p><a name="C7"><strong>And if I showed you some people who &#8211; just like you &#8211; decided to take charge of their financial future, and are now reaping the rewards on offer, doing exactly what you&rsquo;ll learn at  Success Secrets Summit&trade; 2010&#8230;.would you at least believe it is possible for you?</strong></a></p>

<h1>WARNING! WARNING! WARNING!</h1>
<p><span class="hilight"><strong>WARNING #1:</strong></span> Total seating at the Success Secrets Summit&trade; is limited to a few less than 300. There are over several hundred people on our pre-registration list, so we expect them to fill up fast, soon after this event is made available to the public.</p>
<p><span class="hilight"><strong>WARNING #2:</strong></span> No audio or video recordings of the Summit will be made available. If you miss the event, you&rsquo;ll never get an opportunity to be exposed to these experts all in one place again. You must be there in person.</p>
<p><span class="hilight"><strong>WARNING #3:</strong></span> The reason why everyone is clamouring to be a part of this event is because these Wealth Creation Experts are the real deal. They are not 50 times smarter than you. And they don&rsquo;t work 10, 20 or 50 times harder or longer than you. They have simply discovered their own personal &ldquo;wealth formula&rdquo; and proven with irrefutable evidence that they can make huge profits in good times and bad.</p>
<p>And as a result of the current economic resurgence, most of my hand-picked presenters are flat out keeping up with all the money-generating opportunities out there. I&rsquo;ve had to beg, cajole and even twist their arms to share everything they have learnt that would help guide you to achieve your own financial freedom and independence. </p>
<p>By the way, they&rsquo;re not getting on the stage by chance. In fact, here&rsquo;s the criteria we used before selecting our experts&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>They must earn real six or seven figures.</strong> It seems that most people who are charging for financial advice have studied how to &ldquo;DO IT&rdquo; but have never actually done it themselves.</li>
<li><strong>They must be at the top of their game in their specific field of expertise.</strong> I didn&rsquo;t want any pretend experts. Only those who have proven their salt by being &ldquo;in the trenches&rdquo; on a week-to-week basis.</li>
<li><strong>They must be successfully implementing and using these techniques even in tough economic climates.</strong> No sense in teaching you something that is outdated or only works in boom times.</li>
<li><strong>And they must</strong> understand how to explain their strategies in plain talk so you RECEIVE MORE THAN JUST THE MOTIVATION to achieve your dreams, but a workable step-by-step plan to actually do it.</li>

</ul>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t easy separating the &ldquo;wheat from the chaff&rdquo;&#8230; but we managed to gather the world leaders in the <span class="hilight"><strong>4 Key Areas Of Wealth</strong></span> for 2010 and beyond&#8230;</p>

<p>George started his business career working in the Banking Industry, for over eight years, where he began to develop his finance and customer service skills.</p>
<p>This time was punctuated by an eighteen-month break to do his National Service for Australia. Upon leaving the Bank George entered the Automotive Industry and quickly became the top salesperson in a Group of twelve Car Dealerships.</p>
<p>Five and a half years later he started his own used car outlet and operated it very successfully for approximately 9 years.

Refreshed, George came back to the Motor Industry, developing two separate New Car Dealerships and running them successfully for about eight years acquiring a reputation for being a marketing and advertising whiz.</p>

<p>George took his new found skills to his New Car Dealerships, taking them to a whole new level. During that time, he also took time off work to assist at various Trainings both here in Australia and in the US.</p>

<p>George then sold his Car Dealerships, and decided to become a full time Trainer using his time to educate and empower people.</p>
<p>That was about nine six years ago, and George has since conducted Seminars locally in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Also internationally in the Middle East and the United States. During that time, he also became a Certified Trainer of Hypnosis &amp; a Master Trainer of Time Line Therapy. He has certified more people in NLP than most of the other NLP trainers in Australia combined</p>

<h5>Daniel Kertcher</h5>
<p><strong>Daniel Kertcher</strong> is the CEO as well founder of Platinum Pursuits. Toronto, Canada being his birthplace. He was born in 1972 in December, but his family moved to Australia when he was 16 years old. After studying one year of high school in Australia, he was accepted at the University of Queensland where he undertook a Bachelor of Science with a major in Neurophysiology (Brain Research).</p>

<p>In 1993 Daniel Kertcher was going to begin a masters in neurophysiology, but alternatively decided to have an intermission from studying and found employment in the Real Estate Industry. In 1994 he was promoted to Off-Shore Manager for the company and spent almost all of the year in Singapore where he participated in manaagement, marketing and property sales of the business.</p>
<p>Daniel Kertcher became a accredited Real Estate agent in 1995 and founded his own agency, with his business partner and mother, Sharyn. Through the agency they managed most features of property, including investment, devlopment, sales, on-site management and maintenance.</p>
<p>Daniel Kertcher&#8217;s investigation led him to two gentlemen living in New Zealand, Max Lewis and Bruce Barnard. Both these two gentlemen had over 30 years of technical analysis and share trading experience. Both were in their 60&rsquo;s and together had founded the Society of Technical Analysis of New Zealand (STANZ), with Bruce Barnard as the Chairman and President of STANZ. Daniel Kertcher believed he couldn&rsquo;t have found better mentors! So he employed the two gentlemen to instruct him in the stock market. Both gentlemen flew to Australia and spent a week in Australia teaching Daniel Kertcher about trading one on one. Daniel was so awed by them and their knowledge, that he offered them the opportunity to setup a company with him.</p>
<p>MetaShare International opened its first office in 1998, located Auckland, New Zealand. MetaShare taught courses on technical analysis and share trading and proved to be exceedingly popular. Very quickly Daniel Kertcher had teams teaching courses in other NZ cities and opened the new head office in Sydney in 1999. By 2000, MetaShare had more than 3,500 customers with offices in Brisbane, Melbourne, Auckland, Sydney, and regional teams in Wellington and Christchurch.</p>
<p>At that moment, MetaShare had grouped together with other training organisations and was teaching courses in Futures and Options too.

<div id="speaker"><img src="http://quantumchangeseminars.com/programs/wp-content/themes/default/images/ricko_photo.jpg" alt="Rick Otton" width="164" height="185" />
<h5>Rick Otton</h5>
<p><strong>Rick Otton</strong>, the showman of property entrepreneurs and original pioneer of creative property strategies, is internationally admired by the property industry for his maverick real estate concepts. A man of dedicated vision he is founder and CEO of We Buy Houses, a leading property enterprise which Rick has successfully expanded into the international markets of America, the UK, New Zealand and Australia.</p>

<p>Rick&#8217;s success has been achieved through recognising property profits can be maximised when you start to create strategies relating to the terms under which the property is acquired or sold, and not simply relying on price-led strategies. Rick&#8217;s refreshing concepts allow the buying, selling and trading of houses using little or no money of your own to create what everyone is looking for, super-cash flow as well as profits.</p>
<p>Rick was fortunate to be living in America during the late eighties when banks were facing one of the biggest challenges ever seen in finance history, the famous Savings and Loans Crisis. It created an environment where home-loans were practically abolished, leading Rick to create an innovative number of systems using terms finance which allowed people to buy and sell houses without relying on the banks. Fast-forward fifteen years and Rick&#8217;s unique systems and processes are used everyday all over the world.</p>
<p>His dynamic approach to property investment has created We Buy Houses into a successful brand synonymous with entrepreneurship and is now operated side-by-side with a dynamic property education business. With leading real estate courses, education seminars and home study packs, Rick travels the world sharing his strategies, skills and experience. His celebrated energy, passion and mentoring style reflected in his courses, including his legendary Go Direct course.</p>
<p>This enthusiastic, over-achiever has already accomplished many of his life ambitions including: starring in his own TV show, recording an album and travelling the world. Now the industry eagerly awaits the publication of Rick&#8217;s first book, an eccentric mix of business and biography. And if it follows Rick&#8217;s successful life-mantra it will be punctuated with his classic mix of inventiveness and humour.</p>

<h5>Carly Crutchfield</h5>
<p>Hi, I&#8217;m <strong>Carly Crutchfield</strong> and just in case we haven&#8217;t met before let me introduce myself quickly.</p>
<p>I live in Sydney, but Im often travelling around Australia, Asia and Europe lecturing about property, managing my property developments or looking for more deals for my portfolio!</p>
<p>My interest in property started more than 10 years ago when I was a teenager. You see, I left school when I was just 12 years old and by the time I was 16 I knew I had to start making money &#8211; but I had absolutely no qualifications. I discovered property investment when I found a book at my Dad&#8217;s house and I have been on that track (with a few vias here and there!) ever since. I have continued to educate myself through literally hundreds of seminars, books, DVDs, courses and on the job learning.</p>

<p>I have put much of my education into use and lived to see make mistakes, and make profits and see what works and what doesn&#8217;t. And along the way I have come up with a few strategies of my own that have proven to be extremely successful and profitable. To date I have been involved in more than 300 property transactions and over 150 million dollars worth of development including optioning, constructing and selling. After some of my friends saw what I was doing in property they asked if I could show them how to do it too, so I did. Fast forward a few years and I have educated more than 10,000 people on the strategies of property investment and development and seen many of them go on to see the same success and in same cases more!</p>

<div id="speaker"><img src="http://quantumchangeseminars.com/programs/wp-content/themes/default/images/gerogeF_photo.jpg" alt="George Fokas" width="164" height="185" />
<h5>George Fokas</h5>
<p><strong>FACT: Your bank balance reflects your investment in your own Financial Education.</strong><br />
<strong>George Fokas</strong> is a Global Investor and Trader with over 8 years experience. George started investing with Property but found out very quickly that unless you had CASHFLOW, there was a limit to how many properties you could purchase. He went in search of a strategy that could provide him with Cashflow generation from day one and the stock market was the area that could provide this. After completing many courses on the Stock market with very little consistent results, he came across Sharelord&reg; in 2000 which helped him achieve phenomenal results.</p>
<p>George left school at the age of 17 and went straight into a J O B working in the Insurance Industry. George was in this industry for 10 years and for the last 3 years in his J O B was trading the stock market and building his funds and building his pillars. In 2003 George was able to sack his boss and work from home trading the stock market at his leisure generating over and above what he was earning in a J O B. George went into business acquiring 2 child care centres in 2003 and worked in the business till February 2007 where he sold them both. Since February 2007 he has been a stay at home dad with his 2 beautiful children and his wonderful wife.</p>
<p>George trades from home and spend as much time as he can with his family. He gave himself PERMISSION TO SUCCEED!</p>

<p>George came on board with Nik Halik and FFI in June 2007 to support and promote Nik Halik&rsquo;s Sharelord&reg;. George now heads the Sharelord&reg; Support team along with presenting the phenomenal features of Sharelord&reg; to people around the world at various events.</p>
<p>The unveiling of Sharelords&reg; real Stock Market secret of trading is as follows: We open up the majority of our stock market positions with a credit as opposed to a debit position scenario: meaning we generate a guaranteed income premium on our transactions up front as opposed to paying to speculate with the hope of making money like most do.</p>
<p>Sharelord&reg; is a Stock market Curriculum educating people from beginners, Intermediate and Advanced Traders how to trade the US market with our Sharelord&reg; Strategies that incorporate Share Renting for the US Market along with the Sharelord&reg; Recommendation Service.</p>
<p>The Sharelord&reg; education is unlike anything that has ever been created in the world before. There is nothing like it anywhere. It&rsquo;s the most cutting edge, practical and PROVEN &lsquo;down-in-the-trenches&rsquo; program that *YOU* will ever see. Clarity propels itself towards power and profits! To be absolutely clear about your future financial prosperity, you need to have a clear strategy. The Sharelord&reg; education provides an abundantly clear, simple and easy-to-follow blueprint for success.</p>
<p>Very simply, the Education and knowledge you will learn from George and Sharelord&reg; could be the turning point in your financial life. You will discover the ultimate investment enhanced moneymaking skills of Sharelord&reg; in the United States.</p>
<p>George loves to trade and invest on the Stock Market. It is his passion for many reasons. He has the ability to trade anywhere in the world. As long as he can connect to the internet, he can trade and make money. Nowadays that means almost everywhere. He has no boss, no employees and no mounds of paper requiring his daily attention. He sets his own hours and has plenty of time to devote to his family. All George needs is a computer and he is in business. Above all George makes enough money to enjoy a fantastic quality of life all thanks to a consistent conservative Stock Market Strategy.</p>
<p>Fear exists because of risk or at least a failure to understand and manage risk. Past trading experiences reinforces their beliefs when they hear that the markets are down again &#8211; little do they know that you can make more money when the markets drop using some of the strategies in Sharelord&reg;. George decided that he could be most helpful to baby-boomers, new traders, and even experienced investors if he could provide specific information on how to appreciate risk and then how to use strategies that would substantially reduce or, in certain situations, even remove risk entirely. You will learn specifically how to profit in up, down, and sideways markets all thanks to the Mentoring that George provides to his own students.</p>
<p>Whether you are a novice trader, a baby-boomer looking toward retirement, or a seasoned investor, if you are serious about your money and serious about your investments, George believes Sharelord&reg; will help you advance your skills and help you control risk better than you ever have before with consistent conservative returns.</p>

<p>George is an extraordinary Australian who is making a big difference to the quality of other people&rsquo;s lives around the world with his Mentoring for Sharelord&reg; and helping individuals achieve Financial Freedom. He is a sought after Mentor and has travelled the world meeting and Educating over 10,000 individuals. Allow George to help you SUCCEED in life.</p>

<p>Mal is the author of the best selling book &ldquo;Your Right To Be Rich &#8211; The 9 No-Bull Laws Of Speed Wealth&rdquo;, and during this unique event you&rsquo;ll learn the powerful techniques and proven strategies many people have already successfully used to build their wealth.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;ve seen or heard Mal speak before, or if you own everything he has ever written, recorded or produced&#8230; and even if you think of yourself as a super knowledgeable marketer&#8230; during Mal&rsquo;s presentation, you&rsquo;ll hear plenty of information that you have never heard, thought of or even considered before&#8230;</p>
<p>You see, Mal has long believed that &lsquo;Get Rich Quick&rsquo; evokes an undeserved negative response, after all who&rsquo;d want to try and get rich slow? In fact, according to Mal, a common phrase among his members is, &ldquo;When you figure out the &lsquo;money game&rsquo;, you wonder where it&rsquo;s been hiding all these years!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s just some of what you&rsquo;ll discover during Mal&rsquo;s revolutionary presentation:<br />
&bull; Why most people never enjoy total financial freedom.  Right here Mal will reveal the big mistake most people make and why the vast majority will retire broke<br />
&bull; The BIG BIG mistake most people make when they want to make money fast. This outcome needs to be avoided like the plague and will stop you dead in your tracks<br />

&bull; Why most people can&rsquo;t get their head around $100,000 in 100 days. I&rsquo;ll bet YOU don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s possible.  In fact, Mal&#8217;s had $100,000 days!!<br />
&bull; Money is made mentally before it is collected physically. Most people are broke because they have more hang-ups about money then they do about sex!<br />
&bull; The big breakthrough that separates the winners from the losers. How to stop being a loser and start being a winner in the money game<br />
&bull; How to get them to throw money at you. Fewer than 1 in 100 business owners truly understand and apply this strategy correctly. As a consequence they work too hard and earn too little<br />
&bull; How to create killer offers. You can literally afford to get everything else wrong, but if you know how to create killer offers you can still make a fortune<br />
&bull; During your Success Secrets Wealth Creation Seminar, Mal won&#8217;t just speak&#8230; he will present a mind-expanding, brutally honest, &#8220;NO BS&#8221; smorgasbord of some of the most unorthodox, outrageously effective techniques, strategies and marketing &#8216;tricks&#8217; you&rsquo;ll see anywhere in the world!</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&#8217;s No Better Man To Show You Than Mal Emery&rdquo;<br />
&#8220;I joined Mal&#8217;s Platinum coaching group to learn how to make more money in my own wellness practices. Not only did I do that but I have now become a coach myself in the wellness industry and in fact run small and large seminars annually. If you&rsquo;re thinking about coaching there&#8217;s no better man to show you than Mal.&#8221; &#8211; Wayne Pickstone, Hervey Bay Wellbeing Centre, Qld</p></div>

<h5>Ari Galper</h5>
<p>If you flick through the pages of business magazines and sales training material, you will find a constant flow of messages like, &#8216;Focus on closing the sale&#8217;; &#8216;Overcome objections&#8217;; &#8216;Be relentless&#8217;; &#8216;Accept rejection as a normal part of selling&#8217;; &#8216;Use persuasion to get useful information about your prospects&#8217;; and &#8216;Chase the sale&#8217;.</p>

<p>**  How to easily move the sales process forward without having to put pressure on your prospect</p>

<h1>What Kind Of Results Do These Experts<br />
Inspire In Their Students?</h1>

<p><img src="http://programs.qcseminars.com/files/2010/02/case1.jpg" alt="" title="Case Study 1" width="495" height="187" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1753" /></p>
<p>Scott Bywater was miserable and dead broke until he came across a letter from Brett McFall (one of our speakers) and decided to master the art of copywriting. Today Scott is widely regarded as Australia&rsquo;s leading copywriter (his web site is <a href="http://www.copywritingthatsells.com.au" target="_blank">http://www.copywritingthatsells.com.au</a>) and he simply writes ads for business owners to help them get more customers. Has Scott&rsquo;s life changed? Sure has!</p>
<p>Within just a few short years, he was earning a six-figure income and now turns over in excess of $250,000.00 a year. He now walks to work&#8230; starts when he wants&#8230; finishes when he wants&#8230; and is seemingly dumbfounded by the simplicity and enormous freedom he&rsquo;s been able to create just by following Brett&rsquo;s advice. </p>
<p><img src="http://programs.qcseminars.com/files/2010/02/case2.jpg" alt="" title="Case Study 2" width="495" height="187" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1754" /></p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an amazing success story of ex-mine worker Craig Wilke, who &ndash; after a chance meeting with Mal Emery &ndash; created an online and offline information package which shows people how to get a job in mining.</p>
<p>Craig simply runs classified ads in the Career section of newspapers, offering a free report and details to his website. Has Craig&rsquo;s life changed? Sure has! Within a year, he&rsquo;s quit the mines, a job he personally hated because it kept him away from his home and family. He&rsquo;s now living in the picturesque Margaret River wine-making region of Western Australia.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if I hadn&rsquo;t attended that seminar? It would have cost me a significant sum of money. And I could go on and on about several situations where I made a profound decision that literally changed my life. And how a tiny sliver of knowledge or insight has directly, measurably and certainly led to enormous profits and advancement for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>What about you? Will you choose to miss this event because it&rsquo;s inconvenient? Or will you overcome the hassle of finding a flight and a place to stay? (Check with Virgin and Jetstar competing for airspace, flights have never been cheaper. And you&rsquo;ll be amazed at some of the cheap accommodation deals we can direct you to in Sydney/Brisbane/Melbourne/Perth&rsquo;s CBD).</p>
<h1>You&rsquo;ll Come Away From This Event<br />
Wondering Why They Didn&rsquo;t Teach You<br />
How To Become Rich In School?</h1>
<p>The truth is, our underfunded education system is designed to churn out employees. And that&rsquo;s fine for people who have chosen their career path early in life. But the sad fact is 95% of people don&rsquo;t fit the mould, and we&rsquo;ve been hypnotised and brain washed into &lsquo;getting a good education and a well paying job for life&rsquo;. But that&rsquo;s just a sure fire way to step onto the rat race&#8230;and miss out on the true riches life has to offer.</p>
<p><span class="hilight"><strong>School doesn&rsquo;t teach you how to create the wealth, freedom and abundance you desire. It was never designed to do that. </strong></span></p>
<p>But the problem is most people end up getting a job&#8230; get stuck in the 9 to 5 rat race and don&rsquo;t know where to turn or how to get out of this trap they have created for themselves. And the reality is&#8230;</p>

<h1>It&rsquo;s Not Your Fault</h1>
<p>Listen, it&rsquo;s not your fault if you haven&rsquo;t created the wealth you&rsquo;ve always dreamed of because most rich people jealously guard their wealth formulas. And the ones that do give you a bit of advice make everything a) too complicated to understand, and b) sound more difficult than it actually is.</p>
<p>It annoys me that it&rsquo;s all been kept so secret. And that&rsquo;s why a few years ago I, Roberta Faddoul, said &ldquo;Well, looks like it&#8217;s up to me. I&rsquo;ll get all the experts together who are willing to share their information&#8230; get them to walk you through it in step-by-step detail and show ANYONE with an ounce of desire and determination just how easy it is to get rich &ndash; you don&rsquo;t have to be that special. And that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve done so make sure you lock in your seat to the Success Secrets Summit&trade; 2010.</p>
<p>Everyone lavishly praised our last Success Secrets Summit&trade;&ndash; however the thing most people get so excited about is the potential for networking&#8230; the deals made in the hallways&#8230; I know people who have made millions of dollars from this alone&#8230; by meeting people you wouldn&rsquo;t find any other way. Mark my words &ndash; this event will bring together the savviest and most ambitious young guns, the wealthiest old pros (rich people never stop learning), the movers &lsquo;n&rsquo; shakers &ndash; all more than happy to share their knowledge, all looking for new partners, employees, colleagues and allies.</p>

<h1 style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial, sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">So What&rsquo;s Stopping You From Becoming<br />
&lsquo;Financially Free&rsquo; And Enjoying<br />
A HIGH 6 (or even 7) Figure Income &#8211;<br />
And A Sizeable Investment Portfolio &#8211;<br />

So You Can Enjoy The<br />
 Lifestyle You So Richly Deserve?</h1>
<p><span class="hilight"><strong>Is it a lack of opportunities?</strong></span> This is definitely not the case, and sometimes the best opportunities are right under your feet, right where you are standing. As we saw in the previous case studies, ex miner Craig Wilkie had a chance meeting with Mal Emery, and walked away with a million dollar idea, created an information package and is now living a dream lifestyle.</p>
<p><span class="hilight"><strong>Is it a lack of knowledge or skill?</strong></span> Well I certainly don&rsquo;t know what your educational background is, but this isn&rsquo;t rocket science. In fact: some of our most popular presenters don&rsquo;t have tertiary degrees. Heck, some didn&rsquo;t even finish high school. Pete Godfrey, The Wizard of Words, Master Copywriter and Sales Strategist comes from a working class background and openly admits to being a &lsquo;rebel without a clue&rsquo;.  He now teaches business owners, budding copywriters and entrepreneurs how to use the power of words to make a ton of cash.</p>
<p><span class="hilight"><strong>Is it because you don&rsquo;t have time?</strong></span> This may be true if you&rsquo;re currently in a demanding job. But the only way to give yourself the gift of time is to make more money, and leverage your wealth creation strategy so you work smarter, not harder. Many of our real estate and share strategies only take a few hours a week to put into action&#8230;and the results have often been staggering. We&rsquo;ll show you how to make more money (starting part-time if you wish) so you can eventually leave your job&#8230;and spend your time on your terms, not on your employers. </p>

<h1>So What&rsquo;s Really Holding You Back From A Life Of<br />
Financial FREEDOM?</h1>
<p>Is it money? You know I hear this all the time. &ldquo;If only I had the money to start my business&#8230;launch my website&#8230;buy an investment property&#8230;build a share portfolio&rdquo;&#8230;</p>
<p>But if you had the money, would you then seize the opportunity to make your dream lifestyle a reality? I hope so&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>This is why I&rsquo;m giving you the tools, strategies, ideas, steps, presenters, bonuses and secrets</strong> you need to make AS MUCH MONEY as you want&#8230;provided you take action!</p>
<p>If you still haven&rsquo;t decided to attend, I wonder why??? Especially when I&rsquo;m gifting you your attendance fee &#8211; which other seminar organisers would normally charge thousands for, and rightly so considering the calibre of speakers we are assembling for you.</p>

<p><img src="http://programs.qcseminars.com/files/2010/02/undecided1.gif" alt="" title="Still Undecided?" width="293" height="40" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1804" /></p>
<h2>I Can Only Think Of Four Reasons You May Choose Not To Join Us</h2>
<p><strong>#1:</strong> &ldquo;I cant fit it into my schedule&rdquo;<br />
<strong>#2:</strong>  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be sold things&rdquo;<br />
<strong>#3:</strong>  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to enough seminars&rdquo;<br />
<strong>#4:</strong>  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too far to travel&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="hilight"><strong>#1 &ndash; I CAN&rsquo;T FIT IT INTO MY SCHEDULE</strong></span><br />
I hear this from people all the time. They offer up a million reasons as to why they can&rsquo;t put aside a weekend to invest in themselves. Yet these people are the same people who are glued to their television sets to catch the next episode of Australian Idol (not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that, but is it getting you closer to your financial future?).</p>
<p>Listen: if you take any 100 people at the start of their working lives and follow them for 40 years until they reach retirement age, you&rsquo;re going to find that only 1 will be truly wealthy&#8230; and only another 4 will be financially secure, 5 will keep working, not out of choice but out of necessity; 36 will be dead; and 54 will be dead broke &ndash; having to rely on relatives, friends, charity or move in with their children.</p>
<p>The bottom line is only 5% of people become financially successful.</p>
<p>The second bottom line is only 5% of people TAKE THE TIME to educate themselves past their school education.</p>
<p>One thing&rsquo;s for sure &ndash; when you retire you&rsquo;ll have all the time in the world. The only question is will you take a few days out of your schedule now to invest in the education you need to ensure your time in retirement is spent doing the things you are looking forward to doing including travelling&#8230; starting a small business&#8230; moving to a new area&#8230; or buying a boat and sailing around the country instead of living as an &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford it&rdquo; prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="hilight"><strong>#2 &ndash; I DON&rsquo;T WANT TO BE SOLD THINGS</strong></span><br />
Look, I&rsquo;ve put a big &ldquo;No Pitch Zone&rdquo; in this agenda and all the speakers have promised to give the highest quality content. But I really can&rsquo;t understand people whining about this. I can show you measurable, trackable and direct correlation between the people who are rich who buy the most resources and the people who get the biggest income boosts. It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Just one idea can pay you thousands. Wealthy people understand these facts and have an insatiable thirst for more information. The more information you get, the more money you&rsquo;ll end up making.</p>
<p><span class="hilight"><strong>#3 &ndash; I&rsquo;VE BEEN TO ENOUGH SEMINARS</strong></span><br />
Can you make too much money? Are you in danger of being so smart that your head explodes? Return, please to the list of speakers above and ask yourself if there is anything in their presentation that you don&rsquo;t know. Because if there&rsquo;s anything you don&rsquo;t know, then you need to realise that &lsquo;little hinges swing big doors&rsquo; and just one idea&#8230; one insight&#8230; one person you meet could open up a whole new world of prosperity and abundance in your life.</p>
<p><span class="hilight"><strong>#4 &ndash; MELBOURNE/PERTH/SYDNEY/BRISBANE IS TOO FAR TO TRAVEL</strong></span><br />
At the Success Secrets Summit&trade; 2010, we will have a room filled with smart people who have travelled from great distances to be there. Even many who need passports coming from other countries. Each will be spending hundreds of dollars in airfares and accommodation alone.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong> Because they all realise what a difference information from these Wealth Creation Experts can make to their lives. In 2002 or 2003, I forget which, I got a direct mail piece, recognised the sender, and called them on the spur of the moment. That person immediately invited me to their seminar. I was hesitant to attend because I had to travel all the way to America, but I&rsquo;m glad I did because I heard him say one sentence that revealed something to me which has literally been worth millions of dollars.</p>

<p>Simply put, there is no legitimate reason not to grab the bull by the horns and take advantage of this unique opportunity. However not everyone is free to join us.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>I am not interested in sharing this powerful information with anyone who is less than serious about soaking up every word and APPLYING it to make a difference in their lives and the lives of everyone they touch.</p>
<p>I am utterly serious when I say that, since each of these experts has devoted their lives to mastering their craft, I want to restrict access to their material to people who aren&rsquo;t just after &lsquo;light entertainment&rsquo; but actually want to use it to make a difference in their lives and the lives of those they touch.</p>
<p>Also, you should not look at your attendance as some sort of &ldquo;weekend off.&rdquo; And you shouldn&rsquo;t plan to be here if you are going to be tired, hung over, stressed or cynical and whingey. Why? Because&#8230;</p>
<h1>This will Be The Most Intense 2 Days Of Your Life,<br />
And You Must Be Prepared To Take<br />
Hundreds Of Notes</h1>
<p>You can believe the information is going to come faster than you ever dreamed possible. And it&rsquo;s my experience that just one idea you get through the speakers&#8230; the thinking&#8230; the networking&#8230; and the discoveries you make outside of that&#8230; can turn the course of somebody&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>So make sure you bring lots of paper and pens. And if you&rsquo;ve got a business card, bring that too. No cameras will be allowed; no tape recorders, either. No exceptions.</p>
<h2>So, you&rsquo;ve got 2 choices&#8230;</h2>
<p>One&#8230; put off the decision and let others get the unfair advantage you so desperately desire. Sit at home instead and watch &ldquo;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?&rdquo; Continue to agonise and complain about the high cost of living&#8230; and possible interest rate rises. But where&rsquo;s that going to leave you? It&rsquo;s going to leave you working for a boss you don&rsquo;t like&#8230; sitting in bumper to bumper traffic and still getting to work late&#8230; feeling guilty because you don&rsquo;t have the time to spend with your kids that you&rsquo;d like to have. How much more time will you waste? How long will you continue to be a passive onlooker resigned to pinching pennies?</p>
<p>Or Two&#8230; grab the bull by the horns and be one of the lucky people to claim your seat at this ground-breaking event. Leverage off the most successful minds on the planet and discover how to take full advantage of the profit opportunities this current mini-boom is offering. Because it may not last forever. </p>

(source: Centrelink July 2004). You can&rsquo;t argue with the facts. And if you don&rsquo;t learn what the rich and successful are doing differently, it&rsquo;s only going to cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars and your lifestyle in retirement down the track. Others have done it and you can too, especially when you consider the fact you&rsquo;re going to get step-by-step guidance.</p>
<h1>Which brings us to your investment of TIME<br />

by attending the Success Secrets Summit&trade; 2010</h1>
<p>Now you should know that to hire any of my presenters personally would cost a minimum of $1,000 &#8211; $85,000 an hour. Why so expensive? Simply because they have years of cumulative years of experience and, as a result, are in extremely high demand.</p>
<p>And in this event, you&rsquo;re going to get in excess of 15 hours revealing all the tools you need to grow wealthy beyond your wildest dreams no matter what the state of the economy. So if you paid them an hourly rate, you&rsquo;d be shelling out in excess of $10,000 minimum.</p>

<p>Each day of the Success Summit&trade; we&rsquo;ll be giving away over $15,000 in cash and prizes to heaps of attendees at the event. No, that&rsquo;s not a misprint. Over 21 prizes will be given away throughout the weekend giving you all the tools you need to laugh at steadily rising interest rates, food prices and living expenses in the years ahead.

<h1>And You&rsquo;ll Go In The Draw To Win a FREE Ticket to<br />

A Luxury Once in a Lifetime 15 Day Holiday In Egypt<br />
Valued At $12,495</h1>
<p>Can you imagine sitting in your rocking chair one-day and telling your grandkids about your adventures in The Pyramids&#8230; The Sphinx&#8230; The Luxor Temple&#8230; the Museum of Cairo&#8230;with PRIVATE &#038; EXCLUSIVE visits that are normally reserved for royalty, dignitaries &#038; heads of state and the scenery from your First Class Majestic tour down the River Nile?</p>

<p>Well, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a dream because I&rsquo;ve put aside two tickets to the same journey to Egypt President Obama, Prince Charles and Bill Gates and his entourage enjoyed only a few years ago.</p>
<p>You will get the opportunity to transcend your everyday life and enter another world &ndash; a world stretching back as far as 3000 BC&#8230; a holy land abundant in pyramids, temples, history and culture&#8230; a world where time and space will melt away as you journey into the unknown.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll walk away with your mind, body and soul energized as you are exposed to the lost treasures of our past.</p>

<p>All details will be sent to you by email after you register.</p>
<p>Have you ever been made a more irresistible offer? Because if you don&rsquo;t get to this Summit after everything you&rsquo;ve read so far, then you deserve whatever future you end up with. But you can never say that nobody ever tried to help you out. Especially when you consider the fact money is no obstacle because it won&rsquo;t cost you a cent to lock in your seat NOW.</p>

I hate doing it. But once the venue is full&#8230; there&rsquo;s nothing I can do. And fire and safety regulations are particularly strict at these venues.</p>

<p>I look forward to meeting you at<strong> The Success Secrets Summit&trade; 2010</strong>. I am sure it will be one of the most eye-opening and profitable weekends of your life. And I&rsquo;m excited about sharing the experience with you.</p>
<p>With Love and Success </p>

Just for the record, you have my word that there&rsquo;s no catch to this offer. I really don&rsquo;t want to be paid a cent for the $1997 worth of advanced training from the experts&#8230; the $1511.47 in free bonuses&#8230; the chance to win a FREE Ticket to a Luxury 15 Day Holiday in Egypt valued at $12,495 and over $30,000 in additional prizes (over $15,000 each day).</p>

If someone told you there was a treasure worth $100,000 or more right under your nose and that they&rsquo;d lead you to it, FREE&#8230; would you let them?</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;m asking of you. I say that the experts at this event and all the additional bonuses can guide you to wealth that&rsquo;s hiding right beneath your nose and multiply your money a dozen times over.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m right, you&rsquo;ll be <strong>thousands of dollars better off</strong>, and I&rsquo;ll have a customer for life. And if you can&rsquo;t make at least an extra $10,000 within the first 12 months after attending this event &ndash; then I&rsquo;ll eat my shirt &ndash; but it won&rsquo;t cost you a cent and you&rsquo;ll get to keep the bonuses in any case. You come out smelling like a rose either way.</p>
<p>Please &ndash; let me hear from you &ndash; lock in your seat right away. Do it NOW while it&#8217;s HOT!</p></div>

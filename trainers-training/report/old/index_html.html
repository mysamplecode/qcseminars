<h2>Congratulations!</h2>
<p>As somebody who has completed the NLP Master Practitioner level certification you know more about creating your future than 99% of the population. You know how to break negative habits, eradicate fears and phobias and blast through limitations. And you&#8217;ve no doubt used these strategies to improve your relationships, financial well-being and career prospects.</p>
<h2>Well Done!</h2>
<p>Keep it up! And if you&#8217;d like to go to the next level and discover how to maximise your income and contribute to the world by applying NLP training skills to enhance the lives of others, then attending the NLP Trainers Training could be the most important thing you do this year&#8230;</p>
<h2>Mark These Dates In Your Diary Now: Dates TBA</h2>
<p>According to The Book of Lists, the fear of public speaking ranks number one in the minds of the majority of people. Apparently, standing in front of a group or crowd is even scarier than death or disease to the majority of us.</p>

<p>However the rewards of overcoming this fear are significant. In a study by Stanford University MBA graduates, they found the factor which predicted success was not grades. To the contrary, the most successful people were those who were comfortable and confident talking with anybody.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s one of the primary benefits of the NLP Trainers Training. When people listen to our trainer, George Faddoul, many have compared it to downloading the highest quality software for confidence and success directly into their mind. And it&#8217;s not unusual for them to experience positive and dramatic changes to their lives.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, they walk away with a skill which gives them an incredible amount of leverage. You see, as an NLP trainer you can have an impact on one&#8230; a dozen&#8230; a hundred&#8230; or even thousands of people&#8217;s lives at any one time. And that&#8217;s why training is the perfect tool for creating the life of your dreams too. I think the motivational speaker; Zig Ziglar put it perfectly when he said&#8230;</p>

<div>
<h3>You Can Have Everything In Life You<br />
Want, If You Will Just Help Other<br />
People Get What They Want</h3>
</div>
<p>Think about it: most people can only communicate with one person at any one time. But if you are able to assist larger groups of people to instigate change, you can add far more value than the average person. As a result, whether you are an employee or self employed, many people will be willing to pay more for your services in the marketplace.</p>
<p>And it doesn&#8217;t really matter what you currently do. You see, while a small percentage of people attend this event to become an NLP Trainer, virtually everyone can benefit from possessing the golden key and helping people grow in all sorts of different areas.</p>
<p>This is the exact same skill that allowed my father, George, to run a multi-million dollar business before entering the NLP field. This is the same one thing that allowed Jon to create a 7 figure income. This is the same one thing that has made such a profound difference for so many people trained in NLP presentation skills. Once trained it is so easy to see what major international leaders, actors and politicians are trained in NLP it is that obvious and they are that good eg. Oprah, Bill Gates, Anthony Robbins, Tiger Woods, just to name a few. This is the same one thing that can allow you to be a part of the US$1.5 billion coaching industry generated by 30,000 coaches worldwide (according to a 2006 PricewaterhouseCoopers report commissioned by International Coach Federation).</p>
<p>This is the ONE THING which gives you the leverage very few people possess &#8211; sort of like being the only kid in Smallville bullets bounce off and who can zip from location to location so quickly nobody can see him.</p>

<p>Would you like to be able to make a difference to the lives of thousands of people? If so, you can use this NLP Trainers Training to increase your income by utilising the skills you already possess.</p>

<h4>And The Good News Is, You&#8217;ll Get The Same Instruction For A Fraction Of What Everyone Else Has To Pay!</h4>

<h3>QC Seminars NLP Training of Trainers Program Dates TBA</h3>
<div class="box">
<h3>Pay in Full $3,995 (normally $6995)</h3>

<p>Listen: A lot of people in the NLP industry are furious with me for offering the NLP Trainers Training with you at such an affordable price. Especially since it&#8217;s not unusual for people to have to pay anywhere from $5995 to $8995 for this type of training.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s just too bad. My objective is to make all aspects of NLP affordable to everyone. And since I know a lot of people could benefit from the life-changing information we provide at this event just don&#8217;t have $9,000 to spend, I&#8217;ve made it extremely simple for you to attend this program. That&#8217;s right. You won&#8217;t have to pay $6,000, $7,000 or even $9,000. And even though the price will be going up for all future events, I&#8217;ve set the price for this one at just 6 easy monthly payments of $832.50. Or you can save $1000 and pay $3995 upfront.</p>

<p>Which is, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll agree, extremely good rate for 6 days of training where you will learn a skill which provides you with full certification as an NLP trainer&#8230; ongoing support via phone and email&#8230; and the opportunity to get a DVD collection of the entire program. What&#8217;s more, the money is actually irrelevant, because&#8230;</p>
<h3>You Are Also Protected By My<br />
100% Money-Back Guarantee</h3>

<p>Experience the amazing secrets of how to deliver fearless presentations&#8230; inspire any audience with your powerful presence&#8230; and increase your income while helping more people than you ever dreamed possible. See for yourself how quickly and easily you can apply these secrets to command respect in groups and have a greater impact in team environments. Experience how it feels to turn your fear, anxiety and limitations into confidence and courage.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s that simple. If you are not happy (for whatever reason or no reason at all) simply pull me aside and say, "You know something Roberta? I don&#8217;t think this was the right choice for me." And guess what will happen as soon as you tell me?</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m very confident you&#8217;ll love the program, too. Think about it: Standing there with a smile on your face, a group in front of you virtually eating out of your hands, knowing that you are changing lives, having fun and being paid what you are truly worth&#8230; that would be something, wouldn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>You bet it would. And you have absolutely nothing to lose with this super-generous money back guarantee! I have devoted my life to helping good people understand the power of NLP and the sort of impact it can have on their lives &#8211; and I honestly believe that by making the NLP Trainers Training more widely available, together we can make the world a better place.

<p>If I can get you to attend, I know from experience you WILL "see the light" about all this, and be more wealthy and personally fulfilled as a result. One of the most common comments in all the letters I have received over the years about this event is: "I thought about not going, but I am so glad I did." You will feel that way too. I promise. I guarantee it.</p>
<p>However be warned &#8211; <strong>THIS EVENT WILL SELL OUT and we ONLY  have 3 places left.</strong> I&#8217;ve had to turn people away from almost every NLP Trainers Training I&#8217;ve held in the past. It&#8217;s not something I enjoy doing. But once the venue is full&#8230; I have no choice. Safety and fire restrictions prevent it.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to see you at The NLP Trainers Training. I know it will be an event you look back on in the years to come as a turning point in your life. And I&#8217;m looking forward to sharing it with you.</p>

<p>With love &amp; success,</p>

<p>The following is a list of the people in this system's database which have 
  your Referral ID (<span tal:replace="amb_stuff/wid" />) associated with their 
  contact record. This list does not indicate that your referrals have purchased 
  anything, only that they are in the database as your referrals. The information 
  below is intentionally minimal in order to protect the privacy of your referrals.</p>

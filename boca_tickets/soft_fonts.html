<h2>Soft Font Handling</h2>
<p>True Type Soft Fonts are fonts downloaded to the Boca Ticket printers into
  their permanent memory and are referenced by the ticket template using the
  &lt;TTFX,X&gt; command where the first X represents the ID number of the font
  being referenced, and the second X is the point size of the font being printed.
  A good source of TTF fonts online is <a href="http://www.fontemple.com/" target="_blank">http://www.fontemple.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Boca
  provides software for downloading True Type fonts for various operating systems
  here: <a href="http://bocasystems.com/news.html" target="_blank">http://bocasystems.com/news.html</a></p>
<p>True Type Soft Fonts should be downloaded in the following order or the existing
  templates may not print correctly. If the soft fonts are downloaded in the
  wrong order you may need to first clear the download memory on the printer,
  and then upload them again in the correct order (download the fonts here <a href="http://events.quantumchangeseminars.com/boca_tickets/fonts/fonts.zip">http://events.quantumchangeseminars.com/boca_tickets/fonts/fonts.zip</a>)</p>

<p style="color: #FF0000;">***Attention Ticket template editor. If you add new Soft Fonts in the future,
  be sure to have you new fonts added to the zip file linked above and store
  the font file in the /fonts/ folder. You'll also need to have someone modify
  the list above.</p>

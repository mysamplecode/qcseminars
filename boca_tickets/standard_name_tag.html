<p>The width is 3.25 inches x 4.5 inches. An example of the base is below with
  the suggested layout. Looking at the side of the printer with the LCD screen
  and control panels, the tickes will be fed in on the left and the printer mouth
  will expell tickets to the right. The tickets are fed as visually described
below. The Printer's &quot;Special Head&quot; setting must be set to &quot;NO&quot; in order to print
  these larger width tickets. <strong>Be sure also to power the printer off and then
  on again after changing ticket stock sizes.</strong> </p>

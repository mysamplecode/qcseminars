<h2>Dear Friend in NLP,</h2>
<p><strong><br />
As you can see, I&#8217;ve attached a QC Seminars cheque to the top of this letter.<br />

Why have I done this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Actually, there are two reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have something very important to tell you and I needed some way to make sure this letter would get your attention. Make sure you read all the P.S’s for an extra special offer.</li>
<li class="even"> And secondly, since I am about to show you how to save $1,000 off the price everyone else will pay for their NLP Master Practitioner Certification (and get a bundle of extra bonuses which I&#8217;ll reveal below) I thought a $1,000 QC Seminars cheque was especially appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anyway, here is what it&#8217;s all about</strong>: I&#8217;d like to thank you for attending your NLP Practitioner Certification training with us. You made a very wise decision which has no doubt created many positive shifts in your life to date, and I&#8217;m grateful that you gave me the opportunity to share this powerful human change technology with you.</p>

<p>Following the event, I received many positive comments such as: <strong>"My relationship with my family has gone to another level,"</strong> "I&#8217;ve taught my kids to learn faster, so now they&#8217;re no longer struggling with their studies," <strong>"I&#8217;ve increased the profitability of my business by 32%. These communication strategies really work"</strong> among dozens of others.</p>
<p>And of course, many people are interested in taking their NLP education to the next level. And the number one question I receive from these people is&#8230;</p>
<h3>How Can You Afford to Offer Such an<br />
Amazing Discount For The<br />

NLP Master Practitioner Certification?</h3>
<p>I can understand people&#8217;s scepticism&#8230; As the reality is everyone else is charging anything from $6,995 to $8,995 for this event. After all, Nick LeForce is an internationally esteemed trainer, (who has been working with Steve Andreas and Robert Dilts from almost day 1 of NLP) and widely respected throughout the NLP community as one of the key developers of this cutting edge technology&#8230; So it&#8217;s only natural to ask yourself&#8230;</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s The Catch? Why Am I Practically Giving This Program Away?</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s really quite simple. I am passionate about making this opportunity accessible to everyone. After finishing my NLP Master Practitioner Certification, my life changed forever. I started doing NLP therapy &amp; coaching in my spare time on the weekends seeing people for depression, all sorts of phobias and charging $500 an hr for an average of a 5hr total session. Not bad for a 23yr old working part time on the weekends. I saw how taking and applying what I had learnt at the NLP Master level changed my life forever and I was able to help people make MASSIVE changes in a very short amount of time. And as a result, I&#8217;ve made it my life&#8217;s mission to help as many people become exposed to this advanced training as I possibly can.</p>

<p>My intention is to make this seminar available to everyone who is interested in taking their NLP skills to the next mastery level. And at this special offer, even the most sceptical person in the world would be crazy not to come along and find out what it&#8217;s all about. Especially considering the rave reviews we always receive after the program, such as the ones below&#8230;</p>

<h3>If This Event Is So Valuable, Then Why<br />
Am I Bending Over Backwards<br />
To Help You Get There?</h3>
<p>Well, firstly, I have consulted with Nick LeForce and my father, George and together we&#8217;ve decided that it&#8217;s simply good business practice.</p>

<p>After all, many attendees who come to this event, join us as a result of "word of mouth" advertising. So by making such an attractive offer and letting you experience this event, I slash my marketing costs right away. That way I can pass these huge savings onto you.</p>
<p>Makes sense to me. And it means you get an incredible deal with a recognised key-developer of NLP your trainer Nick LeForce.</p>
<h3>What You&#8217;ll Learn Over These 6 Days That Will Make You A Sought After NLP Practitioner</h3>
<p>The benefits of gaining the mastery level NLP are extraordinary. As somebody who has completed the NLP Certification training, you already know how powerful NLP is to assist you in creating more of what you want in life.</p>
<p>However the Master Level training will provide you with the tools to change beliefs and identity at a much deeper level.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why it is so effective. It reveals all the secrets and techniques of the best NLP practitioners on the planet. And your trainer Nick LeForce is a master at taking participants and showing them&#8230;</p>

<h3>How To Model The Deeper Structure<br />
Of Human Patterning</h3>
<p>This is the strategy used either consciously or unconsciously by raving fans of NLP people like &#8211; <strong>Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates</strong> &amp; <strong>Tiger Woods</strong> &amp; every great business person, sales person, actor, mother or friend. By understanding the structure of experience, learning how to easily learn and develop new models for yourself, there is no limit to what you can create for yourself (or help others create for themselves) once you understand &#8220;how you and others work.&#8221;</p>
<p>This heightened awareness takes you to new levels of understanding and behaving. It is a very keen and subtle art, and intricate to the enth degree, and the good news is your trainer, Nick LeForce, makes it plain, easy to follow, and fascinating. Here&#8217;s a taste of what he&#8217;ll be covering in this event&#8230;</p>

<h2>Step # 1: Patterning and Time</h2>
<p>You will learn how to detect and change, if appropriate, the unconscious patterning in yourself and others that leads either to success or failure. What&#8217;s more, you&#8217;ll also discover how your mind codes information and experience. This Module includes working with time, timeline reframing, and reading the sub modality accessing cues others are always unconsciously communicating. You&#8217;ll also learn core questions &#8211; what you are constantly sorting for and attending to in your life in every situation.</p>
<h2>Step # 2: Identity and Beliefs</h2>
<p>The processes in this module are the most powerful taught anywhere to remove the biggest barriers to your success, health, and happiness: your limiting beliefs. You&#8217;ll learn how to &#8220;reimprint&#8221; experiences that resulted in limiting beliefs about yourself and replace undesired beliefs with empowering ones. You will also learn how to integrate conflicting beliefs and belief systems for more wholeness and personal harmony. You&#8217;ll be introduced to &#8220;Sleight of Mouth&#8221; language patterns to loosen limiting beliefs, Reimprinting and Belief change models. You&#8217;ll also learn the Figure/Ground, the NLP pattern that looks the most like &#8220;magic&#8221; for creating change. The advanced belief changes that you&#8217;ll learn are those that Nick LeForce is best known for, and you will benefit from his innovations and teaching elegance.</p>

<h2>Step # 3: Modelling Human Excellence</h2>
<p>NLP originated through its developers modelling highly effective people such as Virginia Satir, Milton Erickson, and Fritz Perls. Many innovations in NLP came from modelling other people who demonstrated excellence. You will learn how to identify exactly how someone does something with personal excellence, and learn the foundation skills for duplicating that excellence. You will also discover your own best strategies and learn more about your own patterning. You&#8217;ll learn modelling processes such as the GEO, adopt a state, vision to action and strategic modelling which employs all the patterning skills in NLP. Most other NLP schools do a "modelling" exercise where you break a board. This is not really modelling from an NLP point of view in fact a 5yr old can break the board without learning &#8216;how to model&#8217;. In our class you will learn exquisite modelling and see Nick LeForce do the closest thing to a miracle before your very eyes and demonstrate a live allergy cure which will blow you away and which you will then learn how to do. Now that&#8217;s powerful modelling at the deeper levels of NLP mastery.</p>
<h2>Step # 4: Understanding yourself and others</h2>
<p>A major NLP Presupposition is that we are consistently creating our own reality through our beliefs, perceptions and filters. Another is that we are constantly communicating these beliefs and filters through our language patterns and non verbal behaviour.</p>
<p>In this module you will learn how to predict someone else&#8217;s (or your own) success in any given situation by linguistically identifying their meta programs in a brief conversational process. Meta programs are linguistic distinctions and are a very precise way of identifying personality type preferences.</p>
<p>All of this is guaranteed to be revealed to you at the event &#8211; and there&#8217;s a whole lot more!</p>



<p><strong>So let me tell you what the deal is: </strong>Simply call our friendly team on 1300 733 642 or click on the  button for your LAST CHANCE special $1,000 DISCOUNT &amp; Free Gift BONUSES worth $2,200 PLUS a Special VIP dinner with Nick LeForce. This offer is time sensitive and will end at this time or as soon as the class is full. HURRY!</p>

<p>Unlike many Master Practitioner NLP programs which sell for upwards of $6,995 &#8211; $8,995 (and don&#8217;t even offer you a world class NLP trainer who has been involved in NLP since the beginning as well as a highly respected key developer of NLP).</p>
<p>Also if you want to pay in full you will receive an extra $1,000 off the already discounted special price. But hurry, places are limited.</p>
<p>That, my friend, is the bargain of a lifetime for anyone serious about transforming both their own lives and the lives of others with this powerful technology. What&#8217;s more, the money is actually irrelevant, because…</p>
<h3>We&#8217;ll Also Give You the Most Generous And Boldest Satisfaction Guarantee that You&#8217;ll Ever get from a Training</h3>

<p>By taking this training it will keep you sleepless and energised with new ideas you can&#8217;t wait to use&#8230; and before the completion of the seventh day (in other words way before the end) you will be absolutely certain you have gained the skills to both change your own life&#8230; AND that your clients would see such powerful results they would be willing to pay up to $500 per hour for, AND you&#8217;ll begin to see how you could generate a six-figure income with your new found skills&#8230; simply, you will be absolutely delighted about being in the training &amp; energised in implementing all your new skills &amp; techniques for your brighter future!</p>
<p>So, as you can see, the choice is yours. All the dates and times are on the Registration form for you. But be warned &#8211; <strong>THIS EVENT WILL SELL OUT.</strong> Once the venue is full&#8230; it&#8217;s out of my hands. Fire and safety restrictions at the venue prevent it. And remember we ONLY offer the NLP Master Practitioner ONCE each year due to our scheduling and Nick comes from San Francisco. This is a great deal &#8211; the best NLP Master Practitioner on the planet and for a fraction of the normal investment.<br />

So if you are at all interested in taking your NLP skills to the next level by attaining Mastery, then do what you can to attend July 1st - 6th in Wollongong. We were fortunate enough to have Nick come and teach this year due to his busy schedule and at this stage we have no idea if we will be privileged enough to get him to come next years. Many students in the past have had to travel to America to attend this World Class Training with Nick LeForce and you NOW have the opportunity to do it right here in Sydney.<br />
I look forward to seeing you at the NLP Master Practitioner Certification. I know it will be the most enlightening (and profitable) 6 days of your life. And I can&#8217;t wait to share it with you.</p>
<p>Warmest Regards,</p>

<h2 style="padding:0px 30px 0px 30px;clear:both;"><img src="images/dearfriend.jpg" width="210" height="54" /></h2>

<p>If you're ready to step up and enjoy a NEW level of success and achievement...</p>

<p>...where you achieve goals and make dreams come true faster, easier and more consistently...</p>

<p>....then you'll want to read every word of this message.  What I'm going to reveal is PERFECT for you.</p>

<p>Let me explain...</p>

<p>As someone who has reached the NLP Practitioner level, you already know how powerful and effective NLP is in making beneficial changes in your life.</p>

<p><img src="http://events.quantumchangeseminars.com/freenlp/report/images/success.jpg" style="float:right;padding-left:20px;width:340px;">You've probably seen in the live training how people can make breakthroughs like overcoming phobias and getting past obstacles that have held them back...</p>

<p> ...and in your own life you've probably experienced greater clarity and power in achieving your goals.</p>

<p>But so far, you've just scratched the surface of what's possible for you.</p>

<p>NLP is such an extraordinarily rich field, with so much to offer you, that it's simply not possible to cover everything in the training at the NLP Practitioner Level.</p>

<p>In any case, you need to have grasped the fundamentals of NLP before you can take advantage of the more advanced strategies and tools.</p>

<p>NOW you're ready for the next step...</p>

<p>...you're ready to discover...</p>

<h2 style="margin-left:150px;">The NLP "Master Code" To Massive Success </h2>

<p>There's already so much in the NLP Practitioner Training that you might have overlooked the &quot;Master Code&quot; or perhaps not fully appreciated how important it is.</p>

<p>But when you understand this code thoroughly...</p>

<p>...and you will when you complete the iNLP Master Practitioner Certification Training...</p>

<p>...what you can achieve is almost limitless.</p>

<p>And not just for yourself.</p>

<p>You see, part of the iNLP Master Practitioner Certification Training is giving you the skills to help other people.</p>

<p>That could be in therapy, coaching, teaching and training or leadership in business.</p>

<p>And, of course, helping other people will help you to get where you want to go faster.</p>

<p>So what is the &quot;Master Code&quot;?  It's...</p>
<img src="images/results.jpg" style="padding-left:40px;" />

<p>This is how it works...</p>

<p>Firstly decide on the results you want.</p>

<p><img src="images/hands.jpg" style="padding-left:10px;float:right;" />Next, determine the strategy, the proven actions that will produce the results you want. This determines the behaviour that's needed.</p>

<p>Then line up the Internal Representation, State and Physiology that will produce the desired behaviour.</p>

<p>When you're working with others, the same code applies with one additional factor.  You use the communication strategies of NLP to help the other person make changes to their Internal Representation, State and Physiology.</p>

<p>As we walk through the major sections of the iNLP Master Practitioner Certification Training... </p>

<p>...you'll see how each section applies to a particular part of the Master Code...</p>

<p>Let's start with...</p>
<h2 style="margin-left:50px;text-align:center;">The Fundamentals Of Success And Mastery...But Not As You've Experienced Them Before</h2>

<p>True mastery begins with complete proficiency in the fundamentals.</p>

<p>Top performers in any field of endeavour, sports, business or the arts, stand out from the crowd because they perform the basics outstandingly well.</p>

<p>The foundation of excellence in NLP is the same.  So you'll start your iNLP Master Practitioner Certification Training with a NEW LOOK at the fundamentals...</p>

<p>...approaching them from a different perspective and at a much higher level.</p>

<p>Here are just some of the areas where you'll gain new insights...</p>


<div id="bluebox">
<ul class="redticks">

<li>
 	The role of emotions and how to maximise their positive impact on your life</li>

 	<li>How the NLP presuppositions can be used correctly to bring more prosperity and success into your life</li>

 	<li>The NLP way to use affirmations (and how to construct your personal set that will get results)</li>

 	<li>Revisiting the NLP Model Of Change (and creating the bridge between the Old World and the brighter New World)</li>

 	<li>The fundamental 6 steps underlying any NLP pattern and what really happens in a particular pattern</li>

 	<li>A secret to gain maximum power in your life that was well known in ancient cultures but has been forgotten in modern times</li>

 	<li>NLP and understanding the mind-body connection (amazingly, it really is possible to increase your brain power...you'll discover how to do this)</li>

 	<li>The NLP Model Of Communication.  Translating communication into action and behaviour faster than you might think possible</li>

 	<li>7 key principles for NLP success...PLUS a checklist that you'll want to keep with you at all times</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>...and much more.</p>

<p>With that review and solid foundation in place, next comes...</p>


<h2 style="margin-left:50px;text-align:center;">Conversational NLP - Your Black Belt in Verbal Martial Arts</h2>

 <p><img src="images/blackbelt.jpg" style="padding-left:10px;float:right;" />Throughout your iNLP Master Practitioner Certification Training, you'll see over and over again how you can apply NLP to get results in EVERY area of your life.</p>

<p>NLP is above all a highly PRACTICAL science that you can use in a wide variety of everyday situations.</p>

<p>And in everyday life you'll often find you get the best results when you apply NLP in a NATURAL way that seems like...</p>

<p>...simply an ordinary conversation.</p>

<p>The best part of this is that people will have no idea of what you're really doing...</p>

<p>...and you'll get results with a minimum of fuss and friction.</p>

<p>In fact, you'll find yourself being thanked on many occasions...</p>

<p>...and people will naturally admire and respect you.</p>

<p>Included in this section of your training is...</p>

<div id="bluebox">
<ul class="redticks">

<li>
 	A deceptively simple linguistic technique that will quickly start the process of solving a problem and in some cases will be all you need to get a successful outcome</li>

 	<li>Discover just how powerful the right language can be in bringing success into your life</li>

 <li>	A fail-safe negotiation model that always produces results in any situation</li></ul>
 </div>
<p>...plus many other conversational strategies that mean you'll always know exactly the right thing to say.</p>

<h2 style="margin-left:50px;text-align:center;">Value Systems - The Hidden Driving Force Behind All Actions</h2>

<p><img src="images/meditate.jpg" style="padding-left:10px;float:right;width:200px;" />Values actually guide your every decision...</p>

<p>...even if you may not be aware of it at the time! </p>

<p>The problem for many people is that they often have little or no idea of their values and what's truly important to them.</p>

<p>You won't be in that position after the iNLP Master Practitioner Certification Training.  In fact, you'll be one of those decisive individuals who can make decisions quickly and confidently...</p>

<p>,,,because you are crystal clear on your values.
You'll discover...</p>






<div id="bluebox">
<ul class="redticks">

<li>
 	What really motivates you, what constitutes your personal conscious and unconscious source of ethics and fulfilment</li>

 	<li>How to identify the part of values which do not serve and support you anymore</li>

 	<li>How to identify and get rid of unconscious values conflicts so that you don't unwittingly get in the way of the success you want</li>

 	<li>Thinking in relation to values and your personal evolution</li>

 	<li>How to change values so that they support your desires and growth</li>

 	<li>How to use values alignment in business, sales, management, relationships and all areas of your life</li>
</ul></div>

<p>...PLUS you'll be introduced to the remarkable work of Dr. Clare Graves and how your values can help adapt to changing circumstances and meet new challenges.</p>

<h2 style="margin-left:20px;text-align:center;">Travelling In Time To Change The Past And Create The Future You Desire</h2>
<p>It might sound extraordinary, but you really  can &quot;travel&quot; forward in time to create the future that you want.&nbsp; </p>
<p>And  the effect of events in the past can be changed in subtle ways so that your  future changes as well.</p>
<p>It's  like having your very own virtual &quot;Time Machine&quot;!</p>
<p>Covered  in this section is&hellip;</p>

<div id="bluebox">
<ul class="redticks">

 	<li>Discovering your own unique &quot;Time Line&quot;...where you've come from and the direction of your future</li>

 	<li>How to let go of negative emotions like anger, sadness, fear and guilt from the past</li>

 	<li>Move beyond limiting decisions and beliefs that have held you back</li>

 	<li>Understand what creates anxiety and how to get rid of it quickly and easily</li>

 	<li>The precise steps to take that will make achieving any goal almost automatic</li>

 	<li>Discover how to create a compelling, motivating and exciting future that's exactly right for you</li>
    </ul></div>
<p>Let's move on to...</p>

<h2 style="margin-left:20px;text-align:center;">Meta-Programs - The Hidden Patterns That Make You Who You Are</h2>

<p>Every  single day we're all faced with having to make dozens, if not hundreds of  decisions.</p>
<p>Meta-Programs  are HOW we make those decisions in the different circumstances that come up.</p>
<p>Understand  Meta-Programs and you have not only a powerful tool to direct your own actions  but also to understand why people act as they do and how to influence them  effectively.</p>
<p>You'll  discover&hellip;</p>
<div id="bluebox">
<ul class="redticks">

 	<li>Meta-programs, what they are and the different types of programs</li>

 	<li>How these inner filters make people have different skills and abilities</li>

 	<li>How to select the people you consider most suitable for certain jobs in a win-win situation (extremely valuable in business)</li>

 	<li>The secrets to discovering Meta-Programs conversationally without seeming intrusive</li></ul></div>
    
<p>...PLUS you'll get special tools and resources to make uncovering and mapping 
Meta-programs a snap.</p>

<p>And...</p>

<h2 style="margin-left:70px;text-align:center;">Modelling Human Excellence</h2>

<p>NLP  originated through its developers modelling highly effective people such as  Virginia Satir, Milton Erickson, and Fritz Perls. Many innovations in NLP came  from modelling other people who demonstrated excellence. </p>
<p>You  will learn how to identify exactly how someone does something with personal  excellence, and learn the foundation skills for duplicating that excellence. </p>
<p>You  will also discover&hellip;</p>
<div id="bluebox">
<ul class="redticks">
 
 	<li>Your own best strategies and learn more about your own patterning</li>

 <p>If  you found the &quot;Fast Phobia Cure&quot; at NLP Practitioner Level impressive&hellip;</p>
 <p>&hellip;you'll  be blown away by seeing how to make a real physical allergy a thing of the  past.</p>
 <p>This  is modelling in action at the very highest level&hellip;</p>
 <p>&hellip;and  rarely will you get the chance to discover these kind of secrets.</p>
 <p>This  section alone is worth the entire investment in the iNLP Master Practitioner  Training.</p>
 <p>That  completes our run through of the course material.</p>
 <p>Now let me introduce you to...</p>

<h2 style="clear:both;margin-left:20px;text-align:center;">How Much Time, Money And 
Frustration Can These Secrets Save You?</h2>

<p>Most NLP Master Practitioner Programs cost upwards of 
  $6,995-$8,995 and don't include many of the advanced 
  techniques and strategies.
  
  But your investment won't be anywhere near that.
  
  Also you'll get the benefit of...</p>
<ol style="margin-left:70px;">
  <li>A special $1,000 bonus</li>
  
  <li> A special payment plan</li>
  
 <li> A special seminar only price.</li>
</ol>
  
  <p><strong>All the details are on the special Priority Registration Form.</strong></p>
  
 <p> As you can see, you're really getting a bargain.</p>
  
<p>  You may wonder...	</p>

<h2 style="margin-left:20px;text-align:center;">What's The Catch? Why Am I Practically 
Giving This Program Away?</h2>

<p>It's  really quite simple. I am passionate about making this opportunity accessible  to everyone. After finishing my NLP Master Practitioner Certification, my life  changed forever. I started doing NLP therapy and coaching in my spare time on  the weekends seeing people for depression, all sorts of phobias and charging  $500 an hour for an average of a 5 hours in a complete series. Not bad for a  23yr old working part time on the weekends. </p>
<p>I  saw how taking and applying what I had learnt at the NLP Master level changed  my life forever and I was able to help people make MASSIVE changes in a very  short amount of time. And as a result, I've made it my life's mission to help  as many people become exposed to this advanced training as I possibly can.</p>
<p>My  intention is to make this seminar available to everyone who is interested in  taking their NLP skills to the next mastery level. And at this special offer,  even the most sceptical person in the world would be crazy not to come along and  find out what it's all about.</p>

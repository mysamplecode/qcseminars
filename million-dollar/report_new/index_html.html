<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>...then please read every word of this letter!</strong></em></p>
<h2>Hello, my name is George Faddoul, and for the last 14 years I've spent <span>thousands of hours on stage</span> presenting, educating, inspiring, training and selling to thousands of people here in Australia, and abroad.</h2>

<p><strong>I've authored 3 books including</strong> <em>The Modern Day Alchemist</em>, <em>The Evolution Of iNLP</em> and <em>How To Get a Bigger Bite Out Of Life</em> <strong>which has already sold over 10,000 copies</strong>. I'm also featured in Dale Beaumont's <strong><em>Success Coaches Exposed</em></strong> series.</p>
<p>Unlike some fly-by-nighter, instant “gurus&quot; who have read a few books, put on a power suit and jumped on stage with high pressure sales tactics...</p>

<p>My unique <strong>‘Million Dollar Speaker Success Secrets'</strong> program is based on personal experience, longevity and <span class="line1">business reality.</span> </p>
<h2>You see...</h2>
<h3>I'll show you how to present and sell from the stage without the HYPE! You'll discover how to convey your unique message with <span>integrity and passion!</span></h3>
<p>Because to survive and thrive in this exciting and profitable industry for as long as I have, you have to make an authentic and believable connection with your audience. </p>
<h2>And anyone who knows me will testify that...</h2>
<h3>I'm absolutely committed to helping my<br />
clients achieve outstanding success<br />

in their business...<br/> as a speaker, trainer or coach!</h3>
<p>I literally live and breathe this stuff. I'm always coming up with new ideas, planning and developing marketing systems that bring in new training clients or seminar attendees.</p>
<p>I'm so motivated to help YOU enjoy success as a speaker I've done something which won't make me popular with other speaking coaches... </p>
<p>Look, I don't want you to misunderstand me. There are many excellent speaking trainers in this industry; who are giving their clients outstanding training and support.</p>
<p>The problem is it's so damn expensive to get started. </p>
<p>In the past, it was frustrating when clients said “NO&quot; to joining my private speaker training program..</p>
<p>I was frustrated because I knew, <strong>beyond</strong> a shadow of a doubt, that the <strong>Million Dollar Speaker Success Secrets</strong> training program we offer here at QC Seminars really is better than anything on the market today.</p>

<h3>My clients welcomed my No HYPE,<br />
professional and integrity based approach<br />
to presentations and public speaking.</h3>
<p>Unlike many speaking programs you see in the marketplace – often big on HYPE and low on substance – mine gave clients the tools and knowledge to attract attendees and clients and make powerful presentations <span class="line1">STRAIGHT AWAY!</span></p>
<p>That's right, my clients got presentations <em>READY TO GO</em>...with all the handouts, extra speaker's notes and PowerPoint slides they needed.  All they had to do was make the presentation... and collect the money</p>



<p>Of course they could also create their own presentations, using the templates provided, if they wished,  quickly and easily; for anything from a one hour corporate training assignment... all the way to full-blown 3-day seminars with hundreds of eager attendees. </p>

<p>And I'll be the first to admit, although many wanted to join my program, most baulked at the investment.</p>



<p>My program was NOT cheap. Because why would anyone reveal their hard-won presenting secrets and systems to quickly build a 6 or 7 figure speaking business....for less than it was truly worth?</p>
<p>You see, I charge as much as <strong>$50,000 a year</strong> to personally train speakers and provide them with turn-key presentation and marketing systems which cost me over $100,000 to design and implement.</p>

<p>Of course, many who needed my program the most found my fees too big of a stumbling block.</p>
<p>Even though I virtually gave them a Turn-Key Speaking Business they could<br />
use to go out the very next day to design, market and put on their profitable seminar or training program.</p>
<p>And that's the reality of the value I gave my private clients.</p>
<p>But that didn't stop their head spinning when I outlined my fees. Yet many people will gladly hand over $50,000...$100,000...even $250, 000 or more on franchise businesses with big overheads, set-up costs and on-going royalties.</p>
<p>It didn't make sense to me...</p>
<h3>Born out of frustration – and just a hint of curiosity – I decided to give 25 people the chance to attend a closed door<br />
Speaker Training Seminar I called<br />
“How To Get A Bigger Bite Out Of Life&quot; <br/>Trainers Training... </h3>

<p>And at a tiny fraction of what I would normally charge for my complete Speaker Business system and one-on-one training.</p>
<p>I guess I wanted to prove to my clients – and myself &#8211; my Speaker training program and systems really worked for almost anyone willing to put in some time and minimal effort (the system does all the work for you).</p>
<p><strong>The lucky 25</strong> who attended are now enjoying a massive boost to their income,<br />
experts status and prestige!<img src="http://programs.qcseminars.com/files/2010/02/want_proof.png" alt="" title="Want Proof?" width="200" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2289" /></p>

<h2>The lucky 25 who attended my beta-seminar got every nugget of gold I could dispense in just 3 power packed days. They also got $67, 652 in powerful bonuses just for showing up...</h2>
<p>(I'll tell you <strong>how you can get these bonuses... FREE...</strong> shortly)</p>

<p>Even the few attendees who were “sceptical&quot; at first are now<span class="line1"> raving fans</span> of my program!</p>
<p>As I said earlier, many people who have expressed interest in starting their own speaking and training business don't believe they can afford my $50, 000 annual fee for private coaching. </p>
<h3>Sure, they'd all say YES to my unique<br />
strategies I personally use to get on stage,<br />
deliver powerful, entertaining and<br />
emotionally charged presentations...<br />
and routinely make more money in an hour<br />
than most make in a month</h3>
<p>Many still feel they don't have the money, the time or the confidence to take charge of their life and give themselves a massive earnings and lifestyle boost.</p>

<p>I truly believe (and have consistently proven over 14 years in the training and speaking business) I can help almost anyone who honestly feels they can make it as a high-earning and respected presenter, trainer or coach.</p>
<p>However, unless I could convince potential speakers and business owners to believe in themselves, and invest in their future...it isn't going to happen for most!</p>
<p>The solution came to me one night as I lay in bed...</p>
<h3>What Would Happen If<br />
I Made My Program So Affordable...<br />
No One In Their Right Mind Could Say NO?</h3>
<p>I knew I couldn't reduce my one-on-one private coaching fee.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Simply because it is so intense and takes up so much of my time, I can't reduce my fee...and only a handful of people could afford to take me up on my program.</p>

<p>And because it's so demanding on my time and energy, I've cut back on the number of private coaching clients I'm taking on these days. I've had to say No to clients who would have gladly cut me a cheque right then and there....simply because I'm focussing on helping more people and creating systems so my clients can make money...without me holding their hand every step of the way.</p>
<p>I want to help every single person who wants to become a successful speaker and trainer...not just a lucky few with the money to invest.</p>
<p>That's when I took my large fee out of the equation, and came up with a win-win solution you'll be interested in hearing about</p>
<h2 class="line1">Here it is...</h2>
<p>Instead of charging you $50,000 a year for my personal “one-on-one&quot; coaching program, I give you the nuts-and bolts of my program through an intense and highly rewarding Business Training. </p>
<p>I'll also give you weekly email access to me for 6 months, as well as monthly teleconference coaching calls.</p>
<h2>...and to make it even more affordable and attractive to you, I'll give you my complete marketing and presentation system (valued at $67, 652 ) so anyone can use my system to go straight out after the seminar, and start presenting and earning more money in a few hours than most make in a month!</h2>
<p>Even though a few people in the know think I'm mad to give so much value away for so little...I've decided your success is that important to me...</p>

<p>You see, the foundation of Quantum Change Seminars is our complete dedication to your success. </p>
<p>I've informed my office and given it the GREEN LIGHT...</p>

<h2>Introducing...<img src="http://programs.qcseminars.com/files/2010/02/solution1.png" alt="" title="Here&#039;s the Solution!" width="202" height="110" class="alignright size-full wp-image-2276" style="padding-bottom: 30px;" /></h2>

<div style="clear:left; height:3px;"></div>
<p>You get to become an <strong>exclusive joint venture partner with us</strong>, and get 50% royalty (instead of the measly 5% other companies pay) for every client you introduce into our NLP Scholarship program, which means you get nearly $400 dollars for every person you send. </p>
<h2>PLUS...</h2>
<p>You also get on-going payments of <strong>10% for every purchase your referral makes</strong> with us... for the <strong>entire lifetime of the client</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is your opportunity to earn a residual income, even if you don't currently have a product or service to sell.</p>
<p>We'll give you the <strong>FREE tickets, emails, tools and Joint Venture kit</strong> so you can begin earning an income immediately.</p>

<p>And the best part: is you don't have to service the client, we'll handle that in-house...you just introduce the client to us and get paid for the lifetime value of the client!
 </p></div>
<div class="break"></div>
<h3>That's a total of $67,652<br />
worth of Bonuses FREE!</h3>
<p>I've left nothing out. Everything you could need to earn a <strong>healthy income</strong> speaking, training and selling from the stage is here in ONE Done-For-You Package:</p>
<p>Anyone who says you can become successful without all of these powerful tools is kidding themselves. </p>
<p>And look, you may eventually become a success taking the long road on your own,<br />
but <strong>why would you?</strong></p>

<p>Not when I've given you everything I've personally used – and taught countless other speakers – to earn a <strong>6 figure plus income</strong> as a professional speaker.</p>
<p>My<strong> ‘Million Dollar Speaker Success Secrets Program'</strong> will dramatically short cut your learning curve and have you up on stage and earning an enviable income...in the shortest possible time. </p>




<p>Just to give you an example of what's possible; in my early days of business consulting <strong>I made $10,000 for a 2-day training</strong> using one of the presentations that you'll get handed to you on a silver platter.</p>
<p>And there's no reason why you can't quickly be doing the same...</p>
<p>Now, you may be thinking...</p>

<h3>Seriously George, why should I believe you? Why would anyone give away $67,652 worth of bonuses <span>FREE?</span></h3>
<h2>I understand you may be sceptical about such an outrageous offer. </h2>
<p>At this stage you may be thinking ‘if it seems too good to be true, it usually is'.</p>

<p><em>What's the catch?</em></p>
<p>Well there are 2 very good reasons why I'm giving away so much value, for such a small investment by comparison.</p>
<p><strong><span>Reason 1</span>:</strong> I sincerely wish to see you succeed as a speaker and presenter. I've been down the long road in my career, and spent the last 14 years – and several hundred thousand dollars – investing in myself and my unique<strong> ‘Million Dollar Speaker Success Secrets Program'</strong>.</p>
<p>Back when I started my speaking business, even though I had mentors they couldn't tell me everything I needed to know.  I didn't have a proven system to follow and I had to discover for myself what really worked.  That involved a lot of hard work, trial and error and a little luck during the journey before I found the gold nuggets and hit the jackpot..</p>
<p>I only started to see the ‘Big Dollars' once I used all the tools contained in my<strong> ‘Million Dollar Speaker Success Secrets Program'</strong>.</p>

<p>The best way I can help you is to give the complete system for speaker success. If I left anything out, the system wouldn't work as quickly and easily for you as it has done for me...and for my past clients who swear by the results they got using the<strong> ‘Million Dollar Speaker Success Secrets Program'.</strong></p>
<h2>I felt I would be cheating you if I left the good stuff out, or worse, asked you to pay for the real secrets later...</h2>
<p>I'm not going to hold back at all. </p>
<p>Ok, ok there is something in this for me and my business too.</p>
<p><strong><span>Reason 2</span>: QC Seminars has been growing at a phenomenal rate in the last few years. So fast we've been listed in BRW's “Top 100 fastest growing companies for 2009 and 2010&quot;</strong></p>
<p>We're proud of our success and are continually looking for new ways to grow. And one of the best ways to grow your business – or any business &#8211; is through a strategy known as a Joint Venture. </p>

<p>This is where you partner with like-minded business owners and share expertise, clients, and more income!</p>
<h2>And that's where you come in. </h2>
<p>As you read earlier, we're giving you the opportunity to become a joint venture partner with us. We'll give you the business tools you need to attract clients and ‘share' them with QC Seminars. </p>
<p>For every person you refer into our NLP Scholarship Program, we'll give you a healthy commission. And every time your referral enrols in other QC Seminars programs you'll get 10% of the sale... which adds up very very quickly to a 6 figure income!.</p>
<p>This means you could earn tens of thousands of dollars in residual income...for years to come. Simply by following our proven <strong>‘Million Dollar Speaker Success Program'</strong></p>
<p>So it makes sense to give our partner (YOU) <strong>every tool, technique and strategy</strong> you need to grow your business. While helping us grow ours too! </p>
<h2>Fair enough?</h2>

<h3>With the TOOLS you get, you can go out the VERY NEXT Day... and begin to earn a substantial full or part-time income speaking from the ‘stage'</h3>
<h2>You'll discover:</h2>
<ul>
<li>How to find people to assist you put on your seminar FREE</li>
<li class="even">How to best prepare for your event</li>
<li>The best thing to focus on when running your event</li>
<li class="even">Why you can let participants attend for a minimal fee, or even FREE, and still make more money in a few days that most people make in a month.</li>
</ul>
<h2>OK I'm curious now George. Please tell me how much I need to invest to get it all?</h2>
<p>Remember, to get me to coach you ‘privately' I'd charge $50,000, that's assuming there's time in my busy schedule to fit you in. And many of my previous clients have paid that price and gone on to successful careers in the speaking and coaching business.</p>

<p>Many are normal business owners who simply want to add another powerful sales tool to their business marketing.</p>
<p>And there are speaker training programs out there that cost <strong>$75,000 plus</strong>, and still don't give you the powerful Million Dollar Speaker Success Bonuses I'm giving away.</p>
<p>Well you can rest easy, because I'm only asking for a fraction of what I'd normally charge. </p>

<h3>Now please understand – This TRAINING Program is NOT for everyone.</h3>
<h2>You shouldn't attend if:</h2>


<ul><li class="even">You have no intention of actually presenting any ideas to anyone (not even your spouse or kids – or even future spouse or kids!) </li>
<li> You are not or don't ever wish to become a business owner </li>
<li class="even"> You are not or never wish to be a coach or consultant </li>
<li> You are not or never wish to be a presenter or trainer</li>
<li class="even"> You don't want to learn the most successful seminar and training business model that's available today</li><ul>

<p>If any of these describes you, please don't take the place of someone who really wants to be successful and make more money in two hours than most people make in a year.</p>


<li class="even">If you have 125 excuses why you can't do this speaking thing, and you're there just to prove me wrong!</li>
</ul>
<p>I find people with this kind of attitude don't or won't learn, and I don't want my time or yours wasted.</p>
<ul>
<li class="even">The $5995 price to attend will cause you financial hardship</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a program I came up for serious students of presentations and speaking who realise the price I'm charging is an absolute bargain. However, if attending means your credit card will be maxed out and bills won't get paid... please stay home and take care of your finances first!</p>
<p>I'll be working very closely with you to develop the Joint Venture part of your business, so you can begin earning a substantial income (potentially tens of thousands of dollars in the next year) immediately!</p>
<p>I only want to work with people who are positive and are aligned with our values, having a <strong>burning desire to succeed</strong> and are willingly to put in a little effort to change their lives for the better!</p>

<p><strong>I hope you are one of those people.</strong></p>
<p>I look forward to seeing you in Sydney so I can help you earn more income, massively boost your presentation skills and potentially make you tens of thousands of dollars this year...<span class="line1"> as our Joint Venture partner.</span></p>

<p>You may not realise it, but this Joint Venture opportunity on its own is worth the whole investment in the training.  The exposure and the doors that it will open will provide you with extraordinary and ample opportunities for residual income enough to give you the lifestyle you deserve...</p>
<p>One more thing...</p>
<p>If this is right for you, you can step forward confidently because here is...</p>

<h3>My Personal Promise And 100% Guarantee</h3>

<div class="guarantee">


<p>To make sure you realise I am serious about the value in this course... You Must Be Absolutely Delighted Or You Can Get A 100% Money-Back REFUND
Please understand I cannot guarantee any specific sum of money or wealth you may realise as a result of attending this event. After all, just like anything in life, for you to be successful you need to implement the strategies and have the drive to follow through. And I cannot judge that.</p>
<p><strong>However I can and will guarantee this...</strong></p>
<p>If after watching and listening to us reveal the secrets, participating in the discussions, and doing the exercises, you are not convinced this is THE most practical, step-by-step, high probability system to get you out of the rat race faster than anything you have ever come across... and you find it disappointing in any way... then by the end of the 1st day of the 3 day program I want you to do something (actually I demand it, because I simply wouldn't feel right about keeping your money)
Just pull any member of our staff aside and simply say, “You know something? I don't think this was the right decision for me.&quot; And guess what will happen the moment you say that? A cheque will be written out ON THE SPOT and you'll be refunded every cent COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY IN FULL. No hassles or forms to fill out. No hard feelings. No problems at all.
What's more, you can keep all your materials...</p>
<p>...and we will also insist on giving you an extra $300 as our way of saying “Thank You&quot; for giving it a fair go. We are so confident in this program that if you chose to attend you will be absolutely blown away by the value you receive.</p>
<p>I think you'll agree, that's a very fair deal for you.</p>

<p><strong>P.P.S.</strong> Remember, when you complete this special business training, you'll have <strong>presentations READY TO GO...</strong>the very next day...with all the handouts, notes and PowerPoints you need.  All you need to do is deliver the presentation...and collect your money.</p>
<p>
<strong>P.P.P.S.</strong> You also get everything the original “Lucky 25&quot; got PLUS new material that I've added since the original “behind closed doors&quot; training.  And your investment is the same as before...even though you're getting EXTRA VALUE.</p>
